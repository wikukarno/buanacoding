faq:
  - question: "Are strings mutable in Go?"
    answer: "No. Strings are immutable byte sequences. Any operation that seems to modify a string actually creates a new string."
  - question: "How do I safely iterate over Unicode characters?"
    answer: "Use for range to iterate over runes (Unicode code points). Indexing by position operates on bytes, not runes."
  - question: "What is the cost of substring slicing?"
    answer: "Slicing creates a new string header referencing the same underlying bytes. Be careful with long-lived substrings of huge strings—they can hold the entire backing array in memory."
  - question: "How can I build strings efficiently in a loop?"
    answer: "Use strings.Builder or bytes.Buffer to avoid repeated allocations when concatenating many pieces."
  - question: "How do I convert between string and []byte?"
    answer: "Use []byte(s) and string(b). They copy data. For zero-copy patterns, consider unsafe only with deep understanding—otherwise, prefer safe copies."
  - question: "What’s the difference between len(s) and number of characters?"
    answer: "len(s) returns the number of bytes, not runes. Use utf8.RuneCountInString(s) to count Unicode code points."

In our series on understanding data types in the Go programming language, after discussing numeric and boolean types, we will now explore strings. Strings are one of the most frequently used data types in programming due to their ubiquitous use in handling text. In Go, strings have several unique characteristics that we will explore in this article.

Introduction to Strings
-----------------------

In Go, a string is a sequence of immutable bytes. This means that once a string value is set, it cannot be changed without creating a new string.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main()  {
    s := "hello world" 
    // s[0] = 'H' // this will result in an error because strings are immutable
    s = "Hello World" // this is valid, creates a new string

    fmt.Println(s)
} 
```

Output

```bash
Hello World

```

Basic Operations
----------------

Basic operations on strings include concatenation and substring extraction. Concatenation can be done using the **+** operator, and substrings can be obtained by slicing.

```go
 package main

func main()  {
    firstName := "John"
    lastName := "Doe"
    fullName := firstName + " " + lastName // String concatenation
    println(fullName)

    hello := "Hello, world!"
    sub := hello[7:] // Extracting a substring
    println(sub)
} 
```

Output

```bash
John Doe
world!

```

String Manipulation
-------------------

The **strings** package in Go provides many functions for string manipulation. Here are a few examples:

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "strings"

func main()  {
    var str = "Hello, World"
    fmt.Println(strings.ToLower(str)) // convert all letters to lowercase
    fmt.Println(strings.ToUpper(str)) // convert all letters to uppercase
    fmt.Println(strings.TrimSpace("   space remover   ")) // trim spaces from both ends
} 
```

Output

```bash
hello, world
HELLO, WORLD
space remover

```

Iteration and Transformation
----------------------------

We can iterate over strings with a **for** loop, and convert strings to byte slices or rune arrays.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main()  {
    str := "Hello, 世界"
    for i, runeValue := range str {
        fmt.Printf("%#U starts at byte position %d\n", runeValue, i)
    }

    // Convert string to byte slice
    byteSlice := []byte(str)
    fmt.Println(byteSlice)

    // Convert string to rune slice
    runeSlice := []rune(str)
    fmt.Println(runeSlice)
} 
```

Output

```bash
U+0048 'H' starts at byte position 0
U+0065 'e' starts at byte position 1
U+006C 'l' starts at byte position 2
U+006C 'l' starts at byte position 3
U+006F 'o' starts at byte position 4
U+002C ',' starts at byte position 5
U+0020 ' ' starts at byte position 6
U+4E16 '世' starts at byte position 7
U+754C '界' starts at byte position 10
[72 101 108 108 111 44 32 228 184 150 231 149 140]
[72 101 108 108 111 44 32 19990 30028]` 

```

Strings and Unicode
-------------------

Go supports Unicode characters, which means that strings can contain characters from any language. This is because Go uses UTF-8 encoding for strings, which can represent all Unicode characters.

```go
 package main

import "fmt"

func main()  {
    const nihongo = "日本語"
    for index, runeValue := range nihongo {
        fmt.Printf("%#U starts at byte position %d\n", runeValue, index)
    }
} 
```

Output

```bash
U+65E5 '日' starts at byte position 0
U+672C '本' starts at byte position 3
U+8A9E '語' starts at byte position 6


```

Conclusion
----------

Strings are a fundamental data type in Go, and understanding how to work with them is essential for any Go programmer. In this article, we explored the basics of strings in Go, including their immutability, basic operations, manipulation, iteration, and Unicode support. Armed with this knowledge, you should be well-equipped to handle strings in your Go programs.

Happy coding!
