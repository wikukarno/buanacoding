When you start building larger applications in Go, having a clean and maintainable project structure is essential. Unlike some other languages or frameworks that enforce certain patterns, Go gives you a lot of freedom in how you organize your code. While this is powerful, it can also lead to messy projects if not handled carefully.

In this guide, we'll explore how to structure Go projects following clean architecture principles and best practices that many professional Go developers use.

## Why Project Structure Matters in Go

A good project structure will help you:
- Make your code easier to read and navigate.
- Make testing and maintenance easier.
- Separate concerns cleanly (API, service, data access, domain logic).
- Prepare your code for scaling and collaboration.

Go doesn't have a strict convention, but the community has adopted patterns that work well, especially for building web APIs, microservices, or CLI tools.

## Basic Go Project Structure

Let's start with a simple example of a Go project structure:

```
my-go-project/
├── cmd/
│   └── myapp/
│       └── main.go
├── internal/
│   ├── ...
├── pkg/
│   ├── ...
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── README.md
```

### Directory Breakdown

- **`cmd/`**
  
  This directory contains the entry points for your application. Each subdirectory under `cmd/` represents a different executable. For example, `myapp/` could be the main application, while `myapp-cli/` could be a command-line interface for the same application.
- **`internal/`**
  
  This directory contains application code that is not meant to be used by external applications. It can include business logic, data access, and other components that are specific to your application.
- **`pkg/`**
  
  This directory contains code that can be used by other applications. It can include libraries, utilities, and shared components that are reusable across different projects.
- **`go.mod`**
  
  This file defines the module and its dependencies. It is created when you run `go mod init`.
- **`go.sum`**
  
  This file contains the checksums of the dependencies listed in `go.mod`. It ensures that the same versions of dependencies are used across different environments.
- **`README.md`**
  
  This file provides documentation for your project, including how to install, run, and use it.


## Clean Architecture Approach (Recommended for Medium/Large Apps)
For larger applications, it's beneficial to adopt a clean architecture approach. This means organizing your code into layers that separate concerns and make it easier to test and maintain.

Suggested structure:

```
my-go-project/
├── cmd/
│   └── myapp/
│       └── main.go
├── internal/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── service/
│   │   ├── handler/
│   │   └── repository/
│   ├── domain/
│   │   ├── model/
│   │   └── service/
│   └── infrastructure/
│       ├── db/
│       ├── api/
│       └── config/
├── pkg/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── middleware/
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── README.md
```

### Directory Breakdown
- **`app/`**
  
  Contains the application logic, including services, handlers, and repositories. This is where the core of your application lives.
  - **`service/`**
  
  Contains business logic and service implementations.
  - **`handler/`**
  
  Contains HTTP handlers or gRPC handlers that interact with the outside world.
  - **`repository/`**
  
  Contains data access code, such as database queries or API calls.
- **`domain/`**
  Contains domain models and services. This is where you define your core business entities and their behaviors.
  - **`model/`**
  
  Contains the domain models, which represent the core entities of your application.
  - **`service/`**
  
  Contains domain services that encapsulate business logic related to the domain models.
- **`infrastructure/`**
  
  Contains code related to external systems, such as databases, APIs, and configuration.
  - **`db/`**
  
  Contains database-related code, such as migrations and connection management.
  - **`api/`**
  
  Contains code related to external APIs, such as clients or adapters.
  - **`config/`**
  
  Contains configuration files and code for loading configurations.
- **`pkg/`**
  
  Contains reusable code that can be shared across different projects. This can include utility functions, middleware, and other shared components.
- **`utils/`**
  
  Contains utility functions and helpers that can be used throughout the project.
- **`middleware/`**
  
  Contains middleware functions for HTTP servers, such as logging, authentication, and error handling.
- **`go.mod`**
  
  Defines the module and its dependencies.
- **`go.sum`**
  
  Contains the checksums of the dependencies listed in `go.mod`.
- **`README.md`**
  
  Provides documentation for your project.

This approach makes it easier to swap your database, refactor your API layer, or even reuse your business logic in different contexts.

## Conclusion
Structuring your Go projects effectively is crucial for maintainability and scalability. By following clean architecture principles and best practices, you can create a project structure that is easy to navigate, test, and extend.

This guide provides a solid foundation for structuring your Go projects, whether you're building a simple CLI tool or a complex web application. Remember that the best structure is one that fits your specific needs and team preferences, so feel free to adapt these suggestions as necessary.

By following these guidelines, you'll be well on your way to creating clean, maintainable, and scalable Go projects that are easy to work with and understand.

Happy coding!
