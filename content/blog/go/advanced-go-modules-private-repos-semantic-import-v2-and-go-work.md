faq:
  - question: "Why does 'go get' fail with '410 Gone' for my private repository?"
    answer: "410 Gone means Go tried fetching through public proxy (proxy.golang.org) which doesn't have access to your private repo. Fix: set GOPRIVATE to bypass proxy: export GOPRIVATE=github.com/yourcompany/* or go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.com/yourcompany/*. This tells Go to fetch directly from VCS, not through proxy. Also check: (1) SSH auth configured: git config --global url.\"git@github.com:\".insteadOf \"https://github.com/\". (2) Access token in .netrc or git credentials if using HTTPS. (3) GOPROXY excludes private domains: GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct. Test: go get -v github.com/yourcompany/private-repo shows fetch method. Common mistake: setting GOPRIVATE without fixing SSH/token auth—fetch still fails but with 'authentication failed'. GOPRIVATE alone isn't enough, needs working VCS access."
  - question: "When should I upgrade to /v2 vs staying on v1 for my Go module?"
    answer: "Upgrade to v2+ when making breaking changes that would break existing users' code. Breaking changes: (1) Removing public functions/types. (2) Changing function signatures (parameters, return types). (3) Changing struct fields. (4) Renaming packages. (5) Changing behavior significantly. Non-breaking (stay v1): (1) Adding new functions. (2) Adding struct fields (if not positional). (3) Bug fixes. (4) Internal refactoring. (5) Performance improvements. Go's semantic import versioning forces v2+ in import path: import github.com/org/lib/v2 vs github.com/org/lib. Benefits: (1) Users upgrade explicitly—won't break on go get -u. (2) Multiple major versions can coexist: import v1 and v2 simultaneously. (3) Clear migration path. Cost: maintaining multiple major versions, users fragmented across versions. Best practice: stay v0.x.x during rapid development (no /v2 requirement), bump to v1 when stable API, v2+ only for necessary breaking changes. Libraries: avoid breaking changes if possible via deprecation + new APIs."
  - question: "What's the difference between go.work and replace directives in go.mod?"
    answer: "go.work is for local multi-module development across repo, replace is for overriding specific dependencies in single module. go.work (Go 1.18+): (1) Workspace file at repo root listing multiple modules: use (./service-a, ./service-b, ./shared). (2) All modules see each other's local changes without publishing. (3) Affects all modules in workspace. (4) .gitignore it—developer-specific, not committed. (5) Use when: monorepo with multiple modules, developing dependent modules together. replace directive in go.mod: (1) Per-module override: replace github.com/external/lib => ../local/lib. (2) Can point to local path or different remote. (3) Committed to repo—affects all users. (4) Use when: forking dependency, patching third-party lib, using local version during development. Key difference: go.work is temporary local setup, replace is permanent redirect in module definition. Best practice: go.work for development, avoid committing replace unless necessary (forked dependency)."
  - question: "How do I debug 'module not found' errors with private repositories?"
    answer: "Systematic debugging: (1) Check GOPRIVATE includes domain: go env GOPRIVATE should show github.com/yourorg/*. (2) Test VCS access: git ls-remote https://github.com/yourorg/private-repo.git (should list refs without 'authentication failed'). (3) Check GOPROXY: go env GOPROXY, ensure doesn't force proxy-only: should have 'direct' fallback. (4) Verbose fetch: go get -v -x github.com/yourorg/repo shows exact commands Go runs. (5) Clear cache: go clean -modcache, retry. (6) Check module path: go.mod 'module' line must match import path exactly. Common issues: (1) Typo in module path: github.com/org/repo vs github.com/org/repo-name. (2) Case mismatch: GitHub case-insensitive but Go case-sensitive. (3) Wrong auth method: using HTTPS without token, or SSH without key. (4) Corporate proxy: HTTPS_PROXY blocks git. (5) VPN required but not connected. Debug tool: GODEBUG=http2debug=2 go get shows HTTP details. If all fails: replace directive as workaround while debugging."
  - question: "Should I commit go.work file to version control?"
    answer: "No, never commit go.work—it's for local development only, like .env files. Reasons: (1) Developer-specific—Alice works on 3 modules, Bob on 2, different use() lists. (2) Absolute paths—./module1 might not exist on other machines. (3) CI/CD should build modules independently—workspace mode can hide dependency issues. (4) Breaks reproducible builds—workspace changes dependency resolution. Add to .gitignore: echo 'go.work' >> .gitignore && echo 'go.work.sum' >> .gitignore. CI/CD: disable workspace: go build -workfile=off or delete go.work in CI scripts. Exception: monorepo teams might commit go.work.example as template, developers copy to go.work. What to commit: go.mod, go.sum for each module. go.work.sum can be gitignored—it's checksum file for workspace dependencies, regenerates automatically. If workspace is essential for project: document in README how to set up, don't rely on committed go.work."
  - question: "How do I handle major version upgrades when users depend on my v1 module?"
    answer: "Gradual migration strategy: (1) Publish v2 alongside v1—maintain both: github.com/org/lib v1.x.x and github.com/org/lib/v2 v2.0.0. (2) Don't force users—they import v2 explicitly when ready. (3) Backport critical fixes to v1—security patches, major bugs. (4) Deprecate v1 eventually—announce EOL timeline (6-12 months). (5) Provide migration guide—document breaking changes, before/after code examples. Implementation: (1) Create v2/ subdirectory or major-version branch. (2) Update go.mod: module github.com/org/lib/v2. (3) Tag release: git tag v2.0.0. (4) Users import: import \"github.com/org/lib/v2\". Compatibility shim: create v1-compat package in v2 that wraps new API with old interface—helps gradual migration. Communication: (1) CHANGELOG.md with breaking changes. (2) GitHub release notes. (3) Deprecation warnings in v1 code: // Deprecated: Use v2 NewClient instead. Example: Kubernetes maintains v1 APIs for years during v2 migration. Never: force-upgrade users by deleting v1 or reusing v1 module path for v2—breaks everyone's builds."

Go modules revolutionized dependency management in the Go ecosystem when they were introduced in Go 1.11. While most developers are familiar with basic module operations like `go mod init` and `go get`, there are several advanced features that can significantly improve your development workflow. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore three critical advanced concepts: working with private repositories, handling semantic import versioning v2 and beyond, and leveraging go.work for multi-module projects.

## Understanding Go Modules Foundation

Before diving into advanced features, let's quickly review the fundamentals. Go modules provide a way to manage dependencies and versioning in Go projects. Each module is defined by a `go.mod` file that declares the module path and its dependencies.

```go
module github.com/yourorg/yourproject

go 1.21

require (
    github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.9.1
    github.com/lib/pq v1.10.9
)
```

The module system uses semantic versioning and provides excellent tooling for dependency resolution. However, as your projects grow in complexity, you'll encounter scenarios that require more sophisticated approaches.

## Working with Private Repositories

One of the most common challenges developers face is working with private repositories. By default, Go tries to fetch modules through public proxies and version control systems, which doesn't work for private code.

### Configuring GOPRIVATE

The `GOPRIVATE` environment variable tells Go which module paths should be treated as private. Set this to prevent Go from attempting to fetch your private modules through public proxies:

```bash
export GOPRIVATE=github.com/yourcompany/*,gitlab.com/yourorg/*
```

You can also set it globally:

```bash
go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.com/yourcompany/*,gitlab.com/yourorg/*
```

### Authentication for Private Repositories

For Git-based private repositories, you'll need to configure authentication. The most secure approach is using SSH keys:

```bash
git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
```

This configuration redirects HTTPS URLs to SSH, allowing Go to use your SSH key for authentication.

For corporate environments using access tokens, you can configure Git credentials:

```bash
git config --global url."https://username:token@github.com/".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
```

### Private Module Proxies

Large organizations often set up private module proxies for better control and caching. You can configure Go to use your private proxy:

```bash
export GOPROXY=https://your-private-proxy.com,https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```

The comma-separated list tells Go to try your private proxy first, then fall back to the public proxy, and finally attempt direct version control access.

## Semantic Import Versioning v2 and Beyond

Go's approach to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) becomes more complex when dealing with major version changes. The language enforces a specific convention for major versions v2 and higher.

### The v2+ Import Path Rule

When a module reaches version 2.0.0 or higher, Go requires the major version to be included in the module path. This ensures import compatibility and prevents confusion between different major versions.

Here's how it works:

```go
// v0 and v1 (traditional)
module github.com/yourorg/yourproject

// v2 and higher
module github.com/yourorg/yourproject/v2
```

### Creating a v2 Module

Let's walk through creating a v2 module. Suppose you have an existing v1 module that needs breaking changes:

1. **Create a new directory structure:**

```
yourproject/
├── go.mod              # v1 module
├── main.go
├── v2/
│   ├── go.mod          # v2 module
│   └── main.go
```

2. **Update the v2 go.mod file:**

```go
module github.com/yourorg/yourproject/v2

go 1.21

require (
    // your dependencies
)
```

3. **Import the v2 module:**

```go
import "github.com/yourorg/yourproject/v2"
```

### Gradual Migration Strategy

When upgrading to v2+, you often need to maintain backward compatibility. Here's a practical approach:

```go
// In your v2 module
package main

import (
    v1 "github.com/yourorg/yourproject"
    "github.com/yourorg/yourproject/v2/internal"
)

// NewClient creates a v2 client while maintaining v1 compatibility
func NewClient(config interface{}) *Client {
    switch cfg := config.(type) {
    case v1.Config:
        return &Client{legacy: true, v1Config: cfg}
    case internal.ConfigV2:
        return &Client{legacy: false, v2Config: cfg}
    default:
        panic("unsupported config type")
    }
}
```

This pattern allows users to gradually migrate from v1 to v2 without breaking existing code.

### Version Selection and Compatibility

Go's module system can handle multiple major versions of the same module simultaneously. This is particularly useful for large codebases:

```go
require (
    github.com/yourorg/yourproject v1.2.3
    github.com/yourorg/yourproject/v2 v2.1.0
    github.com/yourorg/yourproject/v3 v3.0.1
)
```

Each major version is treated as a separate module, allowing for careful migration and testing.

## Mastering go.work for Multi-Module Projects

The `go.work` file, introduced in Go 1.18, provides workspace support for multi-module development. This feature is invaluable for large projects spanning multiple modules or when developing modules that depend on each other.

### Creating a Workspace

Initialize a workspace in your project root:

```bash
go work init ./module1 ./module2 ./module3
```

This creates a `go.work` file:

```
go 1.21

use (
    ./module1
    ./module2
    ./module3
)
```

### Workspace Benefits

The workspace mode offers several advantages:

1. **Local Development**: Changes in one module are immediately visible to others without publishing.
2. **Consistent Versions**: All modules in the workspace use the same dependency versions.
3. **Simplified Testing**: Test interactions between modules without complex setup.

### Practical Workspace Example

Consider a microservices architecture with shared libraries:

```
myproject/
├── go.work
├── shared/
│   ├── go.mod
│   └── auth/
├── userservice/
│   ├── go.mod
│   └── main.go
├── orderservice/
│   ├── go.mod
│   └── main.go
```

The `go.work` file enables seamless development:

```
go 1.21

use (
    ./shared
    ./userservice
    ./orderservice
)

replace github.com/myorg/shared => ./shared
```

### Working with External Dependencies

You can also use workspaces to work on forks or local versions of external dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the dependency locally
git clone https://github.com/external/library.git

# Add it to your workspace
go work use ./library

# Your go.work file now includes the local version
```

This is particularly useful when you need to debug or contribute to external libraries while working on your project.

### Workspace Commands

Go provides several commands for workspace management:

```bash
# Add a module to workspace
go work use ./newmodule

# Remove a module from workspace
go work use -r ./oldmodule

# Update workspace modules
go work sync
```

## Integration with Development Workflows

### CI/CD Considerations

When using advanced module features in CI/CD pipelines, consider these best practices:

1. **Environment Variables**: Set `GOPRIVATE` and `GOPROXY` in your CI environment.
2. **Authentication**: Use service accounts or deploy keys for private repository access.
3. **Workspace Handling**: Disable workspace mode in CI by removing `go.work` or using `-workfile=off`.

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
steps:
  - name: Setup Go
    uses: actions/setup-go@v4
    with:
      go-version: '1.21'
  
  - name: Configure private modules
    run: |
      go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.com/yourorg/*
      
  - name: Build without workspace
    run: go build -workfile=off ./...
```

### Development Best Practices

1. **Version Pinning**: Use specific versions in production but allow flexibility in development.
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated and monitor for security vulnerabilities.
3. **Module Structure**: Organize related functionality into logical modules.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Private Repository Access Issues

When encountering authentication problems:

```bash
# Debug module resolution
go env GOPROXY
go env GOPRIVATE

# Test authentication
git ls-remote https://github.com/yourorg/private-repo.git
```

### Version Resolution Conflicts

For complex dependency scenarios, use `go mod graph` to understand the dependency tree:

```bash
go mod graph | grep yourmodule
```

### Workspace Confusion

If workspace behavior seems unexpected:

```bash
# Check active workspace
go env GOWORK

# Disable workspace temporarily
go build -workfile=off
```

## Advanced Patterns and Tips

### Module Replacement for Development

Use replace directives for local development:

```go
replace github.com/external/module => ../local/module
replace github.com/external/module => github.com/yourfork/module v1.0.0
```

### Conditional Builds with Modules

Combine modules with [build tags](working-with-collections-in-go-arrays-slices-and-maps-explained.html) for environment-specific builds:

```go
//go:build development
// +build development

package config

import "github.com/yourorg/dev-tools/v2"
```

### Testing Module Versions

Create comprehensive tests for version compatibility:

```go
func TestVersionCompatibility(t *testing.T) {
    // Test v1 behavior
    v1Client := v1.NewClient(v1.Config{})
    
    // Test v2 behavior
    v2Client := v2.NewClient(v2.Config{})
    
    // Verify compatibility
    assert.Equal(t, v1Client.Process(), v2Client.ProcessLegacy())
}
```

## Performance and Security Considerations

When working with advanced module features, keep these aspects in mind:

### Security

- Regularly audit dependencies with `go list -m -u all`
- Use `go mod verify` to check module integrity
- Consider using tools like [govulncheck](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck) for vulnerability scanning

### Performance

- Private proxies can significantly improve build times
- Workspace mode may slow down large builds; disable in CI when appropriate
- Use `go mod download` to pre-populate module cache

## Conclusion

Advanced Go modules features unlock powerful capabilities for complex project management. Private repository support enables enterprise development workflows, semantic import versioning ensures long-term maintainability, and go.work simplifies multi-module development.

By mastering these concepts, you'll be better equipped to handle sophisticated Go projects and contribute to large-scale applications. Remember to start small, test thoroughly, and gradually adopt these advanced features as your projects grow in complexity.
