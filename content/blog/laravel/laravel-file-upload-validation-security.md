faq:
  - question: "What's the difference between 'mimes' and 'mimetypes' validation in Laravel?"
    answer: "mimes validates by file extension--'mimes:jpeg,png' checks if extension is .jpeg/.jpg/.png. Easy to bypass: rename malicious.php to malicious.png. mimetypes validates by actual MIME type from file content--'mimetypes:image/jpeg,image/png' uses PHP finfo to read file signature (magic bytes). More secure but slower. Best practice: use both for defense in depth: 'image|mimes:jpeg,png|mimetypes:image/jpeg,image/png'. The image rule is shorthand for common image MIME types. Never rely solely on extension--attackers rename files. For production, combine with extension blocklist: reject .php/.phtml/.phar even if MIME is innocent. Check server MIME detection works: php -r 'echo mime_content_type(\"test.jpg\");'. If finfo is disabled, mimetypes fails--install fileinfo extension."
  - question: "How do I prevent path traversal attacks in Laravel file uploads?"
    answer: "Path traversal (../../../etc/passwd) happens when you concatenate user input into file paths. Prevention: (1) Never use client filename directly: avoid Storage::put($request->input('path'), $file)--attacker sends '../../../public/index.php'. (2) Use Laravel Storage API--store() and storeAs() sanitize paths automatically: $file->store('documents') is safe. (3) Hash filenames: $file->hashName() generates random names like '5f3b8c9a1d2e.jpg'. (4) Validate path input with allowlist: if ($path !== 'avatars' && $path !== 'documents') abort(422). (5) Never use realpath() on user input--still vulnerable to symlink attacks. (6) Block .. in filenames: 'filename' => 'required|string|regex:/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/'. Laravel Storage prevents traversal by default--only risk is manual path building with Storage::put(public_path() . $userInput)."
  - question: "Why must I use hash names or UUIDs instead of original filenames?"
    answer: "Original filenames create security and stability risks: (1) Path traversal--filename='../../../.env' overwrites sensitive files. (2) Code execution--attacker uploads shell.php, accesses via domain.com/uploads/shell.php, runs malicious code. (3) Collision--two users upload 'resume.pdf', second overwrites first. (4) Character issues--filenames with spaces, unicode, or special chars break URLs and filesystems. (5) Privacy leak--'confidential-merger-plan-2025.pdf' in URL exposes info. Solutions: (1) Hash names: $file->hashName() generates unique '3f8e2c1b4d5a6789.pdf' based on content + timestamp. (2) UUIDs: Str::uuid() . '.' . $file->extension() produces '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.pdf'. Store original filename in database if needed for download: 'display_name' => $file->getClientOriginalName(), 'stored_name' => $file->hashName(). Serve with Content-Disposition header to rename on download."
  - question: "What's the difference between public disk and private disk in Laravel file storage?"
    answer: "Public disk (storage/app/public -> public/storage via symlink) serves files directly via web server--fast, but anyone with URL can access. Use for: avatars, product images, public documents. Private disk (storage/app) requires Laravel to stream files--slower, but enforces authorization. Use for: invoices, user documents, sensitive data. Public disk: (1) Store: $file->store('images', 'public'). (2) Create symlink: php artisan storage:link. (3) Access: <img src='{{ asset(\"storage/images/photo.jpg\") }}'>. Private disk: (1) Store: $file->store('invoices'). (2) Stream via controller: return Storage::download('invoices/file.pdf') or Storage::response() for inline display. (3) Check permissions: $this->authorize('download', $invoice) before serving. (4) Signed URLs for temporary access: Storage::temporaryUrl('invoices/file.pdf', now()->addMinutes(10)). Security: public disk exposes files--if storing private data there, anyone can guess URLs. Private disk enforces policies but adds latency."
  - question: "How do I implement virus scanning for uploaded files in Laravel?"
    answer: "Three approaches: (1) ClamAV open-source scanner--install locally or Docker: docker run -d -p 3310:3310 clamav/clamav. Use PHP client: composer require xenolope/quahog, scan after upload: $scanner = new \\Socket\\Raw\\Socket('tcp://127.0.0.1:3310'); $scanner->write('INSTREAM'); $scanner->write(pack('N', filesize($path))); $scanner->write(file_get_contents($path)); $scanner->write(pack('N', 0)); $response = $scanner->read(1024); if (str_contains($response, 'FOUND')) Storage::delete($path). (2) Cloud services (VirusTotal API, MetaDefender)--upload file hash for scanning: $hash = hash_file('sha256', $path); Http::post('virustotal.com/api/v3/files', ['file' => $hash]). (3) Laravel job queue--scan asynchronously: ScanUploadedFile::dispatch($path). Don't block uploads--mark file as 'pending scan', scan in background, delete if infected. For high-throughput apps, sample scan (5% of uploads) to balance security and performance. Log all scan results with file metadata."
  - question: "Why does my file upload fail even though validation passes?"
    answer: "Common causes beyond validation: (1) PHP limits too low--check upload_max_filesize=2M and post_max_size=8M in php.ini. File >2MB fails silently. Increase both (post_max_size must be >= upload_max_filesize). Restart PHP-FPM after changes. (2) Nginx limit--client_max_body_size 1m blocks uploads >1MB with 413 error. Set client_max_body_size 10m; in nginx.conf. Reload nginx. (3) Disk space full--df -h shows 100% usage. Laravel fails silently when storage/app is full. Monitor disk usage. (4) Permissions wrong--www-data can't write to storage/app. Run chown -R www-data:www-data storage && chmod -R 775 storage. (5) PHP max_execution_time=30s times out for large uploads on slow connections. Increase or use chunked uploads. (6) Missing storage symlink--php artisan storage:link not run. Public disk files aren't accessible. (7) Wrong disk configuration in filesystems.php--check 'public' disk root path. Debug: check storage/logs/laravel.log for disk errors, enable debug mode temporarily, test with small file first."

File uploads are simple to build and easy to get wrong. The goal is to accept only what you expect, store files safely, and serve them without opening new risks. The checklist and examples below cover validation, storage, serving, limits, and common pitfalls.

<!--readmore-->

Accept only what you need
-------------------------
Validate every request. If a feature requires only images, do not accept arbitrary files.

```php
// app/Http/Controllers/AvatarController.php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $validated = $request->validate([
        'avatar' => [
            'required',
            'file',
            'image',            // jpeg, png, bmp, gif, svg, webp
            'max:2048',         // KB (2 MB)
            'mimetypes:image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp',
            // or: 'mimes:jpeg,png,webp'
        ],
    ]);

    $path = $request->file('avatar')->store('avatars', 'public');
    auth()->user()->update(['avatar_path' => $path]);

    return back()->with('status', 'Avatar updated');
}
```

Notes
- Prefer `image` plus specific types via `mimetypes` or `mimes`.
- Use size limits (`max`) appropriate for your use case.
- Use `file` to ensure an actual uploaded file is present.

Never trust client MIME only
----------------------------
Laravel’s validator checks MIME using PHP’s file info, but you can add a second check for sensitive paths. For example, block PHP or executable content even if the extension is renamed.

```php
$file = $request->file('upload');
$mime = $file->getMimeType();            // from finfo
$ext  = strtolower($file->getClientOriginalExtension());

if (in_array($ext, ['php','phtml','phar'])) {
    abort(422, 'Invalid file type');
}

// Optional: allowlist only
$allowed = ['image/jpeg','image/png','image/webp','application/pdf'];
abort_unless(in_array($mime, $allowed, true), 422, 'Unsupported file type');
```

Store files safely
------------------
Use Laravel’s filesystem. It handles paths, hashing, and adapters.

```php
// Hash name avoids collisions and hides original names
$path = $request->file('document')->store('documents');          // default disk
$pathPublic = $request->file('image')->store('images', 'public');

// Or place with a custom name
$name = Str::uuid()->toString().'.'.$request->file('image')->extension();
$path = $request->file('image')->storeAs('images', $name, 'public');
```

Tips
- Use `hashName()` or UUIDs, not user-supplied filenames.
- Do not build paths with user input. Let the storage layer resolve paths to avoid traversal (e.g., `../../` cases).
- Keep uploads outside the app code directory.

Public vs private files
-----------------------
Two broad patterns:

1) Public assets (e.g., avatars): store on the `public` disk and create a symlink with `php artisan storage:link`. Serve via the web server directly.

2) Private files (e.g., invoices, reports): store on a private disk and stream through a controller, or generate a signed URL with expiry.

```php
// Stream a private file
public function download(string $path)
{
    $this->authorize('download', $path); // apply your policy
    return Storage::disk('private')->download($path);
}

// Or generate temporary access
URL::temporarySignedRoute(
    'files.show', now()->addMinutes(10), ['path' => $path]
);
```

Block code execution in upload directories
------------------------------------------
Even if uploads sit under `public/`, prevent PHP execution there. For Nginx, only pass real `.php` files in your app directory to PHP‑FPM.

```nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
  include fastcgi_params;
  fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
  fastcgi_pass app:9000;
}

# Never treat arbitrary uploads as PHP
location ~* /storage/.*\.(php|phtml|phar)$ { return 403; }
```

On Apache, use `php_admin_flag engine off` or deny execution in the uploads directory.

Server limits that affect uploads
---------------------------------
Large files can fail before your controller runs.

- Nginx: `client_max_body_size 10m;`
- Apache: `LimitRequestBody`
- PHP: `upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size`, `max_file_uploads`

Set these to realistic values for your application. When debugging production differences, confirm the environment values and caches as described in: [Laravel Environment Configuration]({{< relref "blog/laravel/laravel-environment-configuration-env-issues.md" >}}).

Image processing without blocking requests
-----------------------------------------
Expensive work (resize, thumbnails, metadata stripping) belongs off the main request path.

```php
// dispatch a job to process the stored image
ProcessAvatar::dispatch($path);
```

Inside the job, use a library (e.g., Intervention Image or Imagick) to resize and strip metadata. Restart workers after changing env or config so they read fresh values: see [Fixing Laravel Session and Cache Issues]({{< relref "blog/laravel/fixing-laravel-session-cache-issues.md" >}}).

Serving from S3 or object storage
---------------------------------
S3 works well for both public and private files.

```php
Storage::disk('s3')->putFileAs('invoices', $request->file('pdf'), $name);

// Signed URL for private access
$url = Storage::disk('s3')->temporaryUrl(
    'invoices/'.$name, now()->addMinutes(10)
);
```

Harden S3 buckets: disable public ACLs unless required, use bucket policies, set correct `Content-Type`, and prefer signed URLs for sensitive content.

Quotas, rate limits, and abuse controls
---------------------------------------
Uploads need guardrails:
- Limit file size and types by route.
- Add rate limiting per user or IP to the upload endpoint.
- Enforce per-user quotas (table of used storage) and surface clear errors.
- Log upload attempts (success and rejection) with request context to spot abuse. For log patterns, see: [Advanced Laravel Debugging with Logs]({{< relref "blog/laravel/advanced-laravel-debugging-with-logs.md" >}}).

Validation messages and UX
--------------------------
Return helpful validation errors and keep the form state so users can retry quickly. On SPAs, show progress bars for larger files and handle retries gracefully.

Testing uploads
---------------
Use Laravel’s helpers to test controllers and jobs.

```php
public function test_avatar_upload()
{
    Storage::fake('public');
    $file = UploadedFile::fake()->image('avatar.jpg', 256, 256)->size(1000);

    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create())
         ->post('/profile/avatar', ['avatar' => $file])
         ->assertSessionHasNoErrors();

    Storage::disk('public')->assertExists('avatars/'.$file->hashName());
}
```

Common pitfalls
---------------
- Using original filenames directly. Use hashed names or UUIDs.
- Building file paths from user input. Always go through the storage API.
- Accepting `*/*` MIME or no size limits.
- Doing heavy image work inside the request; use queues.
- Not clearing or rebuilding config caches after environment changes.

Security checklist
------------------
- Validate file type, size, and presence with rules.
- Double‑check MIME with allowlists where needed.
- Hash or randomize filenames; avoid directory traversal by never concatenating user input into paths.
- Block code execution in upload directories.
- Use private storage and signed URLs for sensitive content.
- Set realistic server limits and monitor errors.
- Keep deployment routines predictable to avoid stale config. See: [Deploy Laravel to VPS with Nginx -- Complete Guide]({{< relref "blog/laravel/deploy-laravel-to-vps-with-nginx-complete-guide.md" >}}) and [Laravel Security Best Practices for Production]({{< relref "blog/laravel/laravel-security-best-practices-production.md" >}}).

Summary
-------
Secure uploads come down to strict validation, safe storage, careful serving, realistic server limits, and thoughtful background processing. With hashed names, private disks or signed URLs, non‑blocking image jobs, and clear logs, you minimize risk while keeping the experience smooth for users.
