faq:
  - question: "What's the difference between Log::info() and error_log() in Laravel?"
    answer: "Log::info() uses Laravel's logging system (Monolog)--configurable channels, structured logging, multiple outputs (file/syslog/Slack), automatic context, and formatting. error_log() is PHP's native function--writes to PHP error log (usually php_errors.log), no structure, limited control, harder to search/filter. Use Log::info() for application logging: Log::info('Order created', ['order_id' => $order->id]). Use error_log() never in Laravel--always prefer Log facade. Benefits of Log::info(): (1) Structured context--add arrays, objects. (2) Log levels--info/debug/warning/error/critical. (3) Multiple channels--log to different files: Log::channel('orders')->info(). (4) Formatters--JSON, single line, custom formats. (5) Drivers--file, daily, slack, syslog, errorlog, monolog, custom. (6) Automatic context via Log::withContext(['user_id' => auth()->id()]). (7) Stack driver--log to multiple channels simultaneously. Production best practice: Log::info() with structured data, use channels to separate concerns (security logs, performance logs, business logs)."
  - question: "Why are my logs empty even though I'm using Log::info()?"
    answer: "Common causes ranked: (1) storage/logs directory not writable--PHP-FPM can't create/write files. Fix: chown www-data:www-data storage/logs && chmod 775 storage/logs. (2) Wrong LOG_CHANNEL in .env--LOG_CHANNEL=stack but stack channel misconfigured or disabled. Check config/logging.php channels. (3) Log level filtering--using Log::debug() but channel level set to 'info' or higher, debug messages ignored. Fix: set 'level' => 'debug' in channel config. (4) Cached config--changed logging.php but config:cache has old settings. Fix: php artisan config:clear. (5) LOG_LEVEL env var too high--LOG_LEVEL=error ignores info/debug/warning. Fix: remove or set to debug. (6) Disk full--df -h shows 100%, no space to write logs. Fix: clear space or implement log rotation. (7) Wrong channel--Log::channel('orders')->info() but 'orders' channel doesn't exist. (8) Exception before log executes--code throws error before reaching Log::info(). Debug: (1) Check permissions: ls -la storage/logs. (2) Test: Log::emergency('TEST') (always logged). (3) Check config: php artisan config:show logging.channels.stack. (4) Write test: file_put_contents(storage_path('logs/test.txt'), 'test') to verify directory writable."
  - question: "How do I prevent sensitive data (passwords, API keys) from appearing in logs?"
    answer: "Implement log scrubbing at multiple layers: (1) Custom log processor--add to config/logging.php: 'tap' => [\\App\\Logging\\ScrubSensitiveData::class]. Create processor: class ScrubSensitiveData { public function __invoke($logger) { $logger->pushProcessor(function($record) { $record['context'] = $this->scrubArray($record['context']); return $record; }); }}. (2) Exception handler--exclude sensitive fields: Log::error('Login failed', request()->except(['password', 'password_confirmation', 'token'])). (3) Use Log::withoutContext() for sensitive operations. (4) Mask credit cards/SSN: function maskSensitive($str) { return preg_replace('/\\d{4}(?=\\d{4})/', '****', $str); }. (5) Laravel Debugbar/Telescope--disable in production, they log everything including secrets. (6) .env files--never log env() values directly. (7) Database queries--avoid Log::info($query->toSql(), $query->getBindings()) with user passwords. Best practice: create allowed list of safe fields instead of blocklist. Compliance: GDPR/CCPA require PII protection in logs--implement encryption for stored logs, short retention (7-30 days), and access controls."
  - question: "What's the best log rotation strategy for Laravel in production?"
    answer: "Use daily driver with automatic pruning: 'daily' driver in config/logging.php keeps logs for X days: ['driver' => 'daily', 'path' => storage_path('logs/laravel.log'), 'level' => 'debug', 'days' => 14]. Laravel auto-deletes logs older than 'days'. Strategies by app size: (1) Small apps (<1GB logs/month): daily driver with days: 30, simple and sufficient. (2) Medium apps (1-10GB/month): daily driver with days: 14 + external archival to S3/Backblaze. (3) Large apps (>10GB/month): syslog driver + centralized logging (ELK/Loki), storage/logs only for emergency local backup. Advanced rotation: (1) Logrotate (Linux)--create /etc/logrotate.d/laravel: /var/www/app/storage/logs/*.log { daily, missingok, rotate 14, compress, delaycompress, notifempty, create 0664 www-data www-data, sharedscripts, postrotate php artisan cache:clear endscript }. (2) Separate channels by retention--security logs 90 days, debug logs 7 days, business logs 365 days. (3) Compress old logs: gzip storage/logs/*.log.1 to save 80-90% space. Monitor: set up alerts for disk usage >80%. Production incident: if disk fills, Laravel crashes silently--logs prevent logging."
  - question: "How do I trace a single user request across multiple services/logs?"
    answer: "Implement correlation IDs (request IDs) that follow request through entire lifecycle. Implementation: (1) Generate UUID per request--middleware: $requestId = Str::uuid(); request()->headers->set('X-Request-ID', $requestId); Log::withContext(['request_id' => $requestId]). (2) Pass to queued jobs--in job: protected $requestId; public function __construct($requestId) { $this->requestId = $requestId; } public function handle() { Log::withContext(['request_id' => $this->requestId]); }. (3) Pass to external APIs--Http::withHeaders(['X-Request-ID' => request()->header('X-Request-ID')])->get($url). (4) Store in database--orders table: request_id column, log on creation. (5) Return in responses--response()->json($data)->header('X-Request-ID', $requestId). Search logs: grep 'REQUEST_ID' storage/logs/*.log or use log aggregator. Advanced: OpenTelemetry traces--full distributed tracing with spans: $span = Tracer::startSpan('process_order'); $span->setAttribute('order_id', $id); // ... work ... $span->end(). Benefits: (1) Debug user-reported issues--'I got error at 2pm'--grep by request_id and time. (2) Measure end-to-end latency across microservices. (3) Identify which service failed. (4) Replay specific request for debugging. Standard: use X-Request-ID header (common convention) or X-Correlation-ID."
  - question: "Should I log to files or database in production Laravel?"
    answer: "Files are better for production--faster, no database overhead, simpler. Database logs are anti-pattern for high-traffic apps. Comparison: File logging--(1) Fast: no DB query, just fwrite(). (2) No DB load: database handles business logic, not logs. (3) Rotation built-in: daily driver auto-deletes old logs. (4) Works when DB down: can debug database failures. (5) Standard tools: grep/tail/awk for analysis. Database logging--(1) Slow: INSERT per log entry adds latency. (2) Table bloat: millions of rows, slow queries, large indexes. (3) Backup overhead: logs in database dumps waste space. (4) Circular failure: if DB issue causes errors, logging to DB fails. Use cases for database logs: (1) Admin audit trail (user actions)--searchable UI for admins. (2) Business events (orders, payments)--queryable data, not debugging logs. (3) Compliance logs--immutable audit trail with database ACID guarantees. Best practice: file logging for application logs (errors, debug), database for audit trail (who did what when). Hybrid: log critical events to both--Log::stack(['file', 'database'])->error($msg). Production setup: file logging + ship logs to centralized system (ELK/Loki/CloudWatch) for analysis, archival, alerting. Never: log all Laravel logs to database--you'll regret it at scale."

When your Laravel application starts acting up in production, proper logging becomes your lifeline. Unlike development environments where you can use tools like dd() or dump(), production debugging requires a more sophisticated approach. This comprehensive guide walks you through advanced Laravel debugging techniques using logs that will help you identify, track, and resolve production issues efficiently.

## Understanding Laravel's Logging Architecture

Laravel provides a robust logging system built on top of the Monolog library. The framework offers multiple logging channels, each designed for specific use cases. Before diving into advanced debugging techniques, you need to understand how Laravel handles logging under the hood.

The logging configuration lives in `config/logging.php`, where you can define various channels such as single file, daily rotation, syslog, and even custom channels. Each channel can have different log levels, from emergency down to debug, giving you fine-grained control over what gets logged and where.

When debugging production issues, the key is to log the right information at the right time without overwhelming your storage or degrading performance. This means understanding when to use each log level and structuring your log messages for maximum clarity.

## Setting Up Structured Logging for Better Debugging

Structured logging is crucial for production debugging. Instead of writing plain text messages, structured logs contain additional context that makes searching and filtering much more effective. Laravel's logging system supports structured logging out of the box.

Here's how to implement structured logging in your Laravel application:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

class OrderService
{
    public function processOrder($orderId, $userId)
    {
        Log::info('Order processing started', [
            'order_id' => $orderId,
            'user_id' => $userId,
            'timestamp' => now()->toISOString(),
            'memory_usage' => memory_get_usage(true),
            'request_id' => request()->header('X-Request-ID')
        ]);

        try {
            // Your order processing logic here
            $result = $this->executeOrderLogic($orderId);
            
            Log::info('Order processing completed successfully', [
                'order_id' => $orderId,
                'processing_time' => $this->calculateProcessingTime(),
                'result' => $result
            ]);

            return $result;
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            Log::error('Order processing failed', [
                'order_id' => $orderId,
                'error_message' => $e->getMessage(),
                'error_code' => $e->getCode(),
                'stack_trace' => $e->getTraceAsString(),
                'file' => $e->getFile(),
                'line' => $e->getLine()
            ]);

            throw $e;
        }
    }
}
```

This structured approach provides context that makes debugging significantly easier. You can quickly filter logs by order ID, user ID, or any other relevant parameter.

## Creating Custom Log Channels for Different Purposes

Different types of issues require different logging strategies. Creating custom log channels allows you to separate concerns and make debugging more targeted. Here's how to set up specialized log channels:

```php
// config/logging.php
'channels' => [
    'performance' => [
        'driver' => 'daily',
        'path' => storage_path('logs/performance.log'),
        'level' => 'info',
        'days' => 14,
    ],
    
    'security' => [
        'driver' => 'daily',
        'path' => storage_path('logs/security.log'),
        'level' => 'warning',
        'days' => 30,
    ],
    
    'database' => [
        'driver' => 'daily',
        'path' => storage_path('logs/database.log'),
        'level' => 'debug',
        'days' => 7,
    ],
],
```

Now you can log to specific channels based on the type of issue:

```php
Log::channel('performance')->info('Slow query detected', [
    'query' => $query,
    'execution_time' => $executionTime,
    'affected_rows' => $affectedRows
]);

Log::channel('security')->warning('Failed login attempt', [
    'email' => $email,
    'ip_address' => request()->ip(),
    'user_agent' => request()->userAgent()
]);
```

## Implementing Context-Aware Logging

Context is everything when debugging production issues. Laravel provides several ways to add context to your logs automatically. The most effective approach is to create a logging middleware that adds request-specific context to every log entry.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

class LoggingContext
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $requestId = Str::uuid()->toString();
        $request->headers->set('X-Request-ID', $requestId);
        
        Log::withContext([
            'request_id' => $requestId,
            'user_id' => auth()->id(),
            'ip_address' => $request->ip(),
            'route' => $request->route()?->getName(),
            'method' => $request->method(),
            'url' => $request->fullUrl(),
        ]);

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

This middleware ensures every log entry includes essential debugging information, making it much easier to trace issues across multiple requests or user sessions.

## Advanced Error Tracking and Exception Handling

Exception handling is where most production debugging begins. Laravel's exception handler is your first line of defense, but you need to customize it for effective debugging.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Exceptions;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Exceptions\Handler as ExceptionHandler;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Throwable;

class Handler extends ExceptionHandler
{
    public function report(Throwable $exception)
    {
        if ($this->shouldReport($exception)) {
            Log::error('Exception occurred', [
                'exception_class' => get_class($exception),
                'message' => $exception->getMessage(),
                'code' => $exception->getCode(),
                'file' => $exception->getFile(),
                'line' => $exception->getLine(),
                'trace' => $exception->getTraceAsString(),
                'request_data' => request()->except(['password', 'password_confirmation']),
                'user_id' => auth()->id(),
                'session_id' => session()->getId(),
                'occurred_at' => now()->toISOString(),
            ]);
        }

        parent::report($exception);
    }
}
```

## Database Query Debugging and N+1 Problem Detection

Database-related issues are common in production applications. Laravel provides excellent tools for debugging database queries, but you need to set them up properly for production use.

Enable query logging in your service provider:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        if (config('app.debug') || config('logging.log_queries')) {
            DB::listen(function ($query) {
                if ($query->time > 1000) { // Log slow queries (> 1 second)
                    Log::channel('database')->warning('Slow query detected', [
                        'sql' => $query->sql,
                        'bindings' => $query->bindings,
                        'time' => $query->time,
                        'connection' => $query->connectionName,
                    ]);
                }
            });
        }
    }
}
```

For detecting N+1 problems and other performance issues, you should explore tools mentioned in our [5 Laravel Extensions for Visual Studio Code](https://www.buanacoding.com/2024/04/5-laravel-extensions-that-you-must-install-on-your-visual-studio-code.html) guide, which includes debugging extensions that can help during development.

## Performance Monitoring Through Logging

Performance issues often surface in production first. Implementing performance logging helps you identify bottlenecks before they become critical problems.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

class PerformanceMonitoring
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $startTime = microtime(true);
        $startMemory = memory_get_usage(true);
        
        $response = $next($request);
        
        $endTime = microtime(true);
        $endMemory = memory_get_usage(true);
        
        $executionTime = ($endTime - $startTime) * 1000; // Convert to milliseconds
        $memoryUsed = $endMemory - $startMemory;
        
        if ($executionTime > 2000 || $memoryUsed > 50 * 1024 * 1024) { // 2 seconds or 50MB
            Log::channel('performance')->warning('Performance threshold exceeded', [
                'route' => $request->route()?->getName(),
                'method' => $request->method(),
                'execution_time_ms' => round($executionTime, 2),
                'memory_used_mb' => round($memoryUsed / 1024 / 1024, 2),
                'response_status' => $response->getStatusCode(),
            ]);
        }
        
        return $response;
    }
}
```

## Log Analysis and Monitoring Best Practices

Having logs is only useful if you can analyze them effectively. Here are best practices for log analysis in production environments:

First, implement log rotation to prevent disk space issues. Laravel's daily driver handles this automatically, but you should monitor disk usage regularly.

Second, consider using log aggregation tools. While not strictly Laravel-specific, tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or more modern solutions like Grafana Loki can make log analysis much more powerful.

Third, implement alerting based on log patterns. Critical errors should trigger immediate notifications, while performance degradations might warrant daily summaries.

## Security-Focused Logging for Production

Security incidents require immediate attention, so your logging strategy should include security-specific considerations:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Listeners;

use Illuminate\Auth\Events\Failed;
use Illuminate\Auth\Events\Login;
use Illuminate\Auth\Events\Logout;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

class SecurityEventLogger
{
    public function handleFailedLogin(Failed $event)
    {
        Log::channel('security')->warning('Failed login attempt', [
            'email' => $event->credentials['email'] ?? 'unknown',
            'ip_address' => request()->ip(),
            'user_agent' => request()->userAgent(),
            'attempted_at' => now()->toISOString(),
        ]);
    }

    public function handleSuccessfulLogin(Login $event)
    {
        Log::channel('security')->info('Successful login', [
            'user_id' => $event->user->id,
            'email' => $event->user->email,
            'ip_address' => request()->ip(),
            'logged_in_at' => now()->toISOString(),
        ]);
    }
}
```

## Debugging Production Deployment Issues

When deployment issues occur, having proper logging around your deployment process is crucial. If you're following our [Deploy Laravel Application to VPS with Nginx: Complete Production Guide](https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/deploy-laravel-to-vps-with-nginx-complete-guide.html), you'll want to ensure your deployment scripts include logging at each critical step.

Consider logging configuration changes, migration results, cache clearing operations, and queue worker status. This information becomes invaluable when troubleshooting deployment-related issues.

## Testing Your Logging Strategy

Your logging strategy is only as good as your ability to use it when problems occur. Regularly test your logging setup by:

1. Simulating different types of errors and verifying they're logged correctly
2. Ensuring log rotation works as expected
3. Testing your log analysis and alerting systems
4. Verifying that sensitive information is properly excluded from logs

Remember that effective logging is a balance between having enough information to debug issues and not overwhelming your system with unnecessary data. Start with essential information and gradually add more context as you identify gaps in your debugging process.

## Conclusion

Advanced Laravel debugging with logs requires a systematic approach that considers the unique challenges of production environments. By implementing structured logging, creating targeted log channels, adding proper context, and following security best practices, you create a debugging system that helps you resolve issues quickly and efficiently.

The key to successful production debugging is preparation. Set up your logging infrastructure before you need it, test it regularly, and continuously refine your approach based on the types of issues you encounter. With proper logging in place, production issues become manageable challenges rather than emergency fire drills.

Remember that debugging is an iterative process. As your application grows and changes, so should your logging strategy. Stay proactive, monitor your logs regularly, and don't wait for problems to surface before implementing better logging practices.

## Advanced Third-Party Logging and Monitoring Solutions

While Laravel's built-in logging capabilities are powerful, production applications often benefit from dedicated monitoring and error tracking services. These tools provide advanced features like real-time alerting, error aggregation, performance monitoring, and team collaboration features.

                \Sentry\Breadcrumb::LEVEL_INFO,
                \Sentry\Breadcrumb::TYPE_DEFAULT,
                'order.processing',
                'Starting order processing',
                ['user_id' => auth()->id()]
            )
        );
        
        \Sentry\withScope(function (\Sentry\State\Scope $scope) use ($request) {
            $scope->setTag('order_type', $request->get('type'));
            $scope->setUser([
                'id' => auth()->id(),
                'email' => auth()->user()->email,
            ]);
            
            try {
                // Your order processing logic
            } catch (Exception $e) {
                \Sentry\captureException($e);
                throw $e;
            }
        });
    }

{
    public function report(Throwable $exception)
    {
        if (app()->bound('flare')) {
            app('flare')->context('Order Processing', [
                'user_id' => auth()->id(),
                'session_id' => session()->getId(),
                'request_id' => request()->header('X-Request-ID'),
            ]);
        }
        
        parent::report($exception);
    }

```php
// config/logging.php
'rollbar' => [
    'driver' => 'monolog',
    'handler' => \Rollbar\Laravel\MonologHandler::class,
    'access_token' => env('ROLLBAR_TOKEN'),
    'level' => 'debug',
    'check_ignore' => function($isUncaught, $exception, $payload) {
        return false; // Log all errors
    },
],
```

### Bugsnag: Enterprise Error Monitoring

Bugsnag offers advanced error monitoring with stability scoring and release tracking.

```bash
composer require bugsnag/bugsnag-laravel
```

**Advanced Configuration:**

```php
// config/bugsnag.php
return [
    'api_key' => env('BUGSNAG_API_KEY'),
    'release_stage' => env('APP_ENV'),
    
    'filters' => ['password', 'password_confirmation'],
    
    'project_root' => base_path(),
    
    'callbacks' => [
        function($report) {
            $report->setUser([
                'id' => auth()->id(),
                'name' => auth()->user()->name ?? 'Guest',
                'email' => auth()->user()->email ?? null,
            ]);
        }
    ],
];
```

### Log Management with ELK Stack (Self-hosted)

For organizations preferring self-hosted solutions, the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) provides powerful log aggregation and analysis.

**Laravel Configuration for ELK:**

```php
// config/logging.php
'elk' => [
    'driver' => 'monolog',
    'handler' => Monolog\Handler\ElasticsearchHandler::class,
    'formatter' => Monolog\Formatter\ElasticsearchFormatter::class,
    'handler_with' => [
        'client' => new Elasticsearch\Client([
            'hosts' => [env('ELASTICSEARCH_HOST', 'localhost:9200')]
        ]),
        'options' => [
            'index' => 'laravel-logs',
            'type' => '_doc',
        ],
    ],
],
```

### Choosing the Right Solution

**For Small to Medium Applications:**
- **Sentry** (free tier available) - Best overall solution with great Laravel integration
- **Flare** - Laravel-specific with excellent debugging context
- **Laravel Telescope** - Essential for development environments

**For Enterprise Applications:**
- **Rollbar** or **Bugsnag** - Advanced features, team collaboration, SLA support
- **ELK Stack** - Full control, self-hosted, advanced querying capabilities
- **New Relic** or **Datadog** - Full application performance monitoring beyond just errors

**Budget Considerations:**
- **Free options**: Sentry (limited), Laravel Telescope (dev only)
- **Paid tiers start**: $26/month (Sentry), $49/month (Rollbar)
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for high-volume applications

### Integration Best Practices

When implementing third-party logging solutions alongside Laravel's native logging:

1. **Layer your monitoring**: Use native Laravel logging for application flow, third-party services for error tracking
2. **Configure appropriate sampling**: Don't log every single event to avoid overwhelming your monitoring service
3. **Set up proper alerting**: Configure notifications for critical errors only to prevent alert fatigue
4. **Use correlation IDs**: Track requests across different services and logs
5. **Implement feature flags**: Easily enable/disable monitoring features without code changes

These third-party solutions complement Laravel's native logging capabilities and provide production-grade monitoring that scales with your application's growth and complexity.
