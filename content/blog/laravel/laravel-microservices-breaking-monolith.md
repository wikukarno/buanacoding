faq:
  - question: "When is the right time to break a monolith into microservices?"
    answer: "Break monolith when you experience: (1) Scaling issues--specific modules need independent scaling (payment processing needs more resources than user profiles). (2) Team size--3+ teams working on same codebase causes merge conflicts and deployment bottlenecks. (3) Deployment frequency--changes to one feature require deploying entire app, slowing releases. (4) Technology constraints--need different tech stacks for specific features (Python for ML, Go for real-time processing). (5) Database bottlenecks--single database can't handle load. Don't break monolith when: (1) Team <10 people--operational overhead isn't worth it. (2) App has <100k users--premature optimization. (3) Domain boundaries unclear--you'll create distributed monolith. (4) DevOps maturity low--can't handle Docker/K8s complexity. Start with modular monolith first, then extract services when pain justifies cost."
  - question: "What is the Strangler Fig Pattern and why is it better than a big bang rewrite?"
    answer: "Strangler Fig Pattern gradually replaces monolith functionality with microservices by wrapping legacy code with new services, then slowly migrating traffic. Steps: (1) Identify bounded context (e.g., authentication). (2) Build new service alongside monolith. (3) Use API gateway to route new requests to service, old requests to monolith. (4) Migrate data gradually with dual writes. (5) Once stable, remove monolith code. (6) Repeat for next service. Benefits vs big bang rewrite: (1) Zero downtime--app keeps running during migration. (2) Reduced risk--rollback is easy, migrate one feature at a time. (3) Business continuity--keep shipping features during migration. (4) Learn as you go--fix architecture mistakes early on small services. Big bang rewrites typically fail: 2-3 year timelines, frozen feature development, high risk of failure. Strangler pattern is industry standard for successful migrations."
  - question: "How do you handle data consistency across microservices without distributed transactions?"
    answer: "Microservices avoid distributed transactions (2PC) because they're slow and fragile. Use eventual consistency patterns: (1) Saga pattern--coordinate multi-service operations with compensating transactions: OrderService reserves inventory -> PaymentService charges card -> if payment fails, OrderService releases inventory. (2) Event sourcing--publish domain events that other services consume: OrderCreated event triggers InventoryService to reduce stock, NotificationService to send email. (3) Outbox pattern--write event to local database in same transaction as business data, background worker publishes events to message queue. (4) CQRS--separate read and write models: write to service databases immediately, replicate to shared read database asynchronously. Trade-offs: accept temporary inconsistency (order shows as pending while payment processes), implement idempotency (handle duplicate events), use correlation IDs for tracing. Most business operations tolerate eventual consistency--strict consistency only needed for financial transactions."
  - question: "What's the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication in microservices and when to use each?"
    answer: "Synchronous: Service A calls Service B via HTTP and waits for response (REST/gRPC). Use when: (1) Need immediate response--user profile must load before rendering page. (2) Simple request/response--GET user by ID. (3) Strong consistency required--payment authorization must complete before order confirmation. Trade-offs: tight coupling (if B is down, A fails), latency adds up (A->B->C = sum of all latencies), cascading failures. Asynchronous: Service A publishes event to message queue, Service B consumes later (RabbitMQ/Redis/SQS). Use when: (1) Fire-and-forget operations--send email, update analytics. (2) High throughput--process thousands of orders/sec. (3) Loose coupling--order service doesn't need to know about inventory service. (4) Resilience--if inventory service is down, events queue and process when it recovers. Trade-offs: complexity (need message broker), eventual consistency, harder to debug. Best practice: async for inter-service events, sync for client-facing APIs."
  - question: "How do you handle authentication and authorization across microservices?"
    answer: "Centralized authentication with distributed authorization pattern: (1) Auth Service issues JWT tokens after login: POST /auth/login -> returns signed JWT with user_id, roles, expiry. (2) API Gateway validates JWT signature--rejects invalid tokens before routing to services. (3) Each service validates token and enforces authorization: validate JWT middleware extracts user from token, check policies: if (!$user->can('edit', $order)) abort(403). (4) Token contains claims: user_id, roles, permissions--services use these for authorization decisions without calling auth service. Implementation: Use Laravel Sanctum for session-based SPA auth or Passport/custom JWT for API tokens. Services share JWT secret (symmetric) or public key (asymmetric RSA) to verify tokens. Don't pass tokens between services--use correlation ID for tracing, assume caller already authenticated. Refresh token flow: short-lived access tokens (15min), long-lived refresh tokens stored securely. This avoids central auth service bottleneck while maintaining security."
  - question: "Are microservices always better than monoliths?"
    answer: "No--microservices solve specific problems but introduce complexity. Use monolith when: (1) Early-stage startup--domain boundaries unclear, rapid iteration needed. (2) Small team (<10 people)--can't manage operational overhead of 20+ services. (3) Simple CRUD apps--no need for independent scaling. (4) Limited DevOps expertise--can't handle Docker/K8s, monitoring, distributed tracing. Monolith benefits: simpler deployment, easier debugging, single codebase, ACID transactions, lower latency. Microservices benefits: independent scaling, technology diversity, team autonomy, fault isolation. But: network latency, eventual consistency, distributed debugging, operational complexity, higher infrastructure costs. Pattern: start with modular monolith (clear bounded contexts, separate modules), extract to microservices when scaling/team issues justify cost. Many successful companies run monoliths (Basecamp, GitHub for years). Microservices are architectural tax--only pay when scaling/organizational benefits outweigh complexity. Default to monolith unless you have specific reasons to distribute."

As your Laravel application grows, you might find yourself hitting the limitations of a monolithic architecture. Database bottlenecks, deployment challenges, and team coordination issues become increasingly common. The solution? Transitioning to a microservices architecture that breaks your monolith into smaller, manageable, and independently deployable services.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the entire process of decomposing your Laravel monolith into microservices, from initial planning to practical implementation strategies.

## Understanding Monolith vs Microservices

A monolithic application packages all functionality into a single deployable unit. While this approach works well for small to medium applications, it presents several challenges as your application scales:

**Monolith Limitations:**
- Single point of failure affects the entire application
- Difficult to scale individual components independently
- Technology stack limitations across the entire application
- Complex deployment processes for small changes
- Team coordination challenges in large development teams

**Microservices Benefits:**
- Independent deployment and scaling of services
- Technology diversity across different services
- Improved fault isolation and resilience
- Better team autonomy and faster development cycles
- Easier maintenance and testing of smaller codebases

However, microservices also introduce complexity in terms of service communication, data consistency, and operational overhead. The key is knowing when and how to make the transition effectively.

## When to Consider Breaking Your Monolith

Before diving into microservices, evaluate whether your application truly needs this architectural shift. Consider microservices when you experience:

**Performance Issues:**
- Database queries becoming increasingly complex and slow
- Specific modules requiring different scaling strategies
- Resource contention between different application features

**Development Challenges:**
- Multiple teams working on the same codebase causing conflicts
- Deployment bottlenecks due to application size
- Difficulty implementing different technologies for specific features

**Business Requirements:**
- Need for independent feature releases
- Compliance requirements for data isolation
- Different availability requirements for various services

## Planning Your Microservices Architecture

Successful decomposition requires careful planning and a clear understanding of your application's domain boundaries.

### Domain-Driven Design Approach

Start by identifying bounded contexts within your application. These represent distinct business capabilities that can operate independently:

```php
// Example: E-commerce bounded contexts
- User Management (authentication, profiles, permissions)
- Product Catalog (inventory, categories, search)
- Order Management (cart, checkout, fulfillment)
- Payment Processing (transactions, refunds, billing)
- Notification Service (emails, SMS, push notifications)
```

### Data Decomposition Strategy

One of the most challenging aspects of breaking a monolith is handling shared data. Each microservice should own its data completely:

**Database-per-Service Pattern:**
```php
// Before: Single database with all tables
users, products, orders, payments, notifications

// After: Separate databases per service
UserService: users, user_profiles, user_preferences
ProductService: products, categories, inventory
OrderService: orders, order_items, shipping
PaymentService: transactions, payment_methods
NotificationService: notifications, templates
```

### API Contract Design

Define clear API contracts between services before implementation. This allows teams to work independently while ensuring compatibility.

```php
// User Service API Contract
GET /api/users/{id}
POST /api/users
PUT /api/users/{id}
DELETE /api/users/{id}

// Product Service API Contract
GET /api/products
GET /api/products/{id}
POST /api/products
PUT /api/products/{id}
```

## Implementation Strategies

### The Strangler Fig Pattern

Instead of a complete rewrite, gradually replace monolith functionality with microservices:

**Step 1: Identify the First Service**
Choose a bounded context with minimal dependencies. User authentication is often a good starting point.

**Step 2: Create the Service**
```php
// routes/api.php in new Auth Service
Route::middleware('api')->group(function () {
    Route::post('/login', [AuthController::class, 'login']);
    Route::post('/register', [AuthController::class, 'register']);
    Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->group(function () {
        Route::get('/user', [AuthController::class, 'user']);
        Route::post('/logout', [AuthController::class, 'logout']);
    });
});
```

**Step 3: Route Traffic Gradually**
Use a proxy or API gateway to route specific requests to the new service while maintaining existing functionality.

### Database Decomposition

Separate shared data carefully to maintain data integrity:

```php
// Migration strategy for user data
// 1. Create new user service database
// 2. Set up data synchronization
// 3. Update monolith to read from service API
// 4. Remove user tables from monolith database

// User Service Model
class User extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'password'];

    public function profile()
    {
        return $this->hasOne(UserProfile::class);
    }
}

// Monolith integration
class UserServiceClient
{
    public function getUser(int $userId): array
    {
        $response = Http::get("http://user-service/api/users/{$userId}");
        return $response->json();
    }

    public function createUser(array $userData): array
    {
        $response = Http::post('http://user-service/api/users', $userData);
        return $response->json();
    }
}
```

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication

Use HTTP APIs for real-time data retrieval and immediate consistency requirements:

```php
// Product Service calling User Service
class ProductController extends Controller
{
    public function show(Product $product)
    {
        $user = app(UserServiceClient::class)->getUser(auth()->id());

        return response()->json([
            'product' => $product,
            'user_preferences' => $user['preferences'] ?? []
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Asynchronous Communication

Implement event-driven architecture for loose coupling and better performance:

```php
// Event publishing in Order Service
class OrderCreated extends Event
{
    public $order;

    public function __construct(Order $order)
    {
        $this->order = $order;
    }
}

// Event listener in Notification Service
class SendOrderConfirmation
{
    public function handle(OrderCreated $event)
    {
        Mail::to($event->order->customer_email)
            ->send(new OrderConfirmationMail($event->order));
    }
}

// Event listener in Inventory Service
class UpdateInventory
{
    public function handle(OrderCreated $event)
    {
        foreach ($event->order->items as $item) {
            $this->inventoryService->decreaseStock(
                $item->product_id,
                $item->quantity
            );
        }
    }
}
```

## Handling Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Authentication and Authorization

Implement centralized authentication with distributed authorization:

```php
// JWT token validation middleware
class ValidateJWTToken
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $token = $request->bearerToken();

        if (!$token || !$this->validateToken($token)) {
            return response()->json(['error' => 'Unauthorized'], 401);
        }

        $request->merge(['user' => $this->getUserFromToken($token)]);

        return $next($request);
    }

    private function validateToken(string $token): bool
    {
        // Validate JWT token against auth service
        $response = Http::get('http://auth-service/api/validate', [
            'token' => $token
        ]);

        return $response->successful();
    }
}
```

### Logging and Monitoring

Implement distributed tracing for better observability:

```php
// Correlation ID middleware
class CorrelationIdMiddleware
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $correlationId = $request->header('X-Correlation-ID') ?? Str::uuid();

        Log::withContext(['correlation_id' => $correlationId]);

        $response = $next($request);
        $response->headers->set('X-Correlation-ID', $correlationId);

        return $response;
    }
}
```

## Data Consistency and Transactions

### Eventual Consistency

Accept that data will be eventually consistent across services:

```php
// Saga pattern for distributed transactions
class OrderSaga
{
    public function handle(CreateOrderCommand $command)
    {
        try {
            // Step 1: Reserve inventory
            $this->inventoryService->reserveItems($command->items);

            // Step 2: Process payment
            $payment = $this->paymentService->charge($command->paymentDetails);

            // Step 3: Create order
            $order = $this->orderService->create($command->orderData);

            // Step 4: Send confirmation
            event(new OrderCreated($order));

        } catch (Exception $e) {
            // Compensating actions
            $this->rollbackSaga($command);
            throw $e;
        }
    }

    private function rollbackSaga(CreateOrderCommand $command)
    {
        $this->inventoryService->releaseReservation($command->items);
        // Additional rollback actions...
    }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

Microservices can introduce latency due to network calls. Implement strategies to minimize performance impact:

### Caching Strategies

```php
// Service-level caching
class UserServiceClient
{
    public function getUser(int $userId): array
    {
        return Cache::remember("user.{$userId}", 3600, function () use ($userId) {
            $response = Http::get("http://user-service/api/users/{$userId}");
            return $response->json();
        });
    }
}

// Database query optimization
class ProductService
{
    public function getProductsWithCategories(): Collection
    {
        return Cache::tags(['products', 'categories'])
            ->remember('products.with.categories', 1800, function () {
                return Product::with('category')->get();
            });
    }
}
```

### Connection Pooling

Configure connection pooling to reduce HTTP overhead:

```php
// config/http.php
return [
    'timeout' => 30,
    'pool' => [
        'connections' => 10,
        'max_requests' => 100,
    ],
];
```

## Testing Microservices

Testing becomes more complex with distributed systems. Implement comprehensive testing strategies:

### Contract Testing

```php
// User service contract test
class UserServiceContractTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_get_user_returns_expected_structure()
    {
        $response = $this->getJson('/api/users/1');

        $response->assertStatus(200)
            ->assertJsonStructure([
                'id',
                'name',
                'email',
                'created_at',
                'profile' => [
                    'avatar',
                    'bio'
                ]
            ]);
    }
}
```

### Integration Testing

```php
// Service integration test
class OrderCreationIntegrationTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_order_creation_updates_inventory()
    {
        // Arrange
        $product = Product::factory()->create(['stock' => 10]);
        $orderData = ['product_id' => $product->id, 'quantity' => 2];

        // Act
        $response = $this->postJson('/api/orders', $orderData);

        // Assert
        $response->assertStatus(201);
        $this->assertEquals(8, $product->fresh()->stock);
    }
}
```

## Deployment and DevOps

Microservices require robust deployment and monitoring strategies:

### Containerization

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for a Laravel microservice
FROM php:8.1-fpm

WORKDIR /var/www

COPY composer.json composer.lock ./
RUN composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

COPY . .
RUN php artisan config:cache && php artisan route:cache

EXPOSE 9000
CMD ["php-fpm"]
```

### Service Discovery

Use service discovery for dynamic service location:

```php
// Service registry integration
class ServiceRegistry
{
    public function register(string $serviceName, string $host, int $port): void
    {
        Http::post('http://consul:8500/v1/agent/service/register', [
            'Name' => $serviceName,
            'Address' => $host,
            'Port' => $port,
            'Check' => [
                'HTTP' => "http://{$host}:{$port}/health",
                'Interval' => '10s'
            ]
        ]);
    }

    public function discover(string $serviceName): array
    {
        $response = Http::get("http://consul:8500/v1/health/service/{$serviceName}");
        return $response->json();
    }
}
```

## Monitoring and Observability

Implement comprehensive monitoring across all services:

```php
// Health check endpoint
class HealthController extends Controller
{
    public function check()
    {
        $checks = [
            'database' => $this->checkDatabase(),
            'redis' => $this->checkRedis(),
            'external_services' => $this->checkExternalServices()
        ];

        $overall = collect($checks)->every(fn($check) => $check['status'] === 'ok');

        return response()->json([
            'status' => $overall ? 'ok' : 'error',
            'checks' => $checks,
            'timestamp' => now()->toISOString()
        ], $overall ? 200 : 503);
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Avoiding Distributed Monolith

Don't create a distributed monolith where services are too tightly coupled:

**Problem:** Services calling each other synchronously for every operation
**Solution:** Use asynchronous messaging and event-driven architecture

### Managing Data Consistency

**Problem:** Maintaining ACID transactions across services
**Solution:** Implement eventual consistency and compensating actions

### Service Granularity

**Problem:** Creating too many small services or too few large services
**Solution:** Follow domain boundaries and business capabilities

For comprehensive [performance optimization techniques]({{< relref "blog/laravel/laravel-performance-optimization-15-techniques.md" >}}) and [security best practices]({{< relref "blog/laravel/laravel-security-best-practices-production.md" >}}), make sure to implement proper monitoring and security measures across all your microservices.

## Conclusion

Breaking a Laravel monolith into microservices is a significant architectural decision that requires careful planning and execution. Start small, focus on domain boundaries, and gradually decompose your application while maintaining system reliability.

The key to successful microservices adoption lies in understanding your specific use case, implementing proper communication patterns, and maintaining strong DevOps practices. Remember that microservices are not a silver bullet -- they solve certain problems while introducing others.

Consider complementing your microservices architecture with proper [API authentication using Sanctum]({{< relref "blog/laravel/laravel-api-authentication-sanctum-2025.md" >}}) and implementing robust error tracking and monitoring to ensure your distributed system operates smoothly in production.

Take your time with the transition, validate each step, and ensure your team is prepared for the operational complexity that microservices bring. With the right approach, you'll build a scalable, maintainable system that can grow with your business needs.
