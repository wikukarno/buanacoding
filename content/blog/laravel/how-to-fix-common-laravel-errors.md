faq:
  - question: "Why does Laravel break after running composer update or composer install?"
    answer: "Composer updates dependencies and their service providers, which may introduce breaking changes, require new configs, or change autoload mappings. After composer install/update, always run composer dump-autoload -o to rebuild autoload files. Then clear and rebuild caches: php artisan config:clear && php artisan cache:clear && php artisan route:clear && php artisan view:clear. If errors persist, check vendor/composer/installed.json for version changes, read package changelogs for breaking changes, and verify your Laravel version compatibility matrix."
  - question: "What's the difference between cache:clear, config:clear, and route:clear?"
    answer: "cache:clear flushes application cache (data cached via Cache facade), config:clear removes cached config files from bootstrap/cache/config.php (needed when you change .env or config files), route:clear removes cached route definitions from bootstrap/cache/routes-v7.php (needed when adding/changing routes). view:clear removes compiled Blade templates from storage/framework/views. After deployment or config changes, run all four clears, then rebuild with config:cache, route:cache, view:cache in production. Only cache configs/routes in production--cached routes break when using route closures."
  - question: "Why do errors persist after I fix the code?"
    answer: "Laravel caches configs, routes, views, and even opcache stores compiled PHP. After code changes, clear caches: php artisan optimize:clear clears everything. Restart PHP-FPM (sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm) to clear opcache. Restart queue workers (php artisan queue:restart) since they run persistently. Check browser cache (hard refresh with Ctrl+F5). For API/AJAX, clear browser cookies and local storage. In Docker, rebuild containers. Verify changes deployed to correct server/environment. Check file timestamps to confirm deployment actually updated files."
  - question: "What are the best tools for debugging Laravel errors?"
    answer: "Install Laravel Debugbar (barryvdh/laravel-debugbar) for development--shows queries, timeline, views, and exceptions in browser toolbar. Use Laravel Telescope for production-like monitoring with query logs, jobs, exceptions, and requests. Enable query logging in boot() to log all SQL: DB::listen(fn($query) => Log::info($query->sql, $query->bindings)). Use Ray (by Spatie) for better dd() debugging. For production, use Sentry or Bugsnag for error tracking. Check logs with tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log. Use tinker for testing: php artisan tinker to run code interactively."
  - question: "What's the difference between a 419 error and a 500 error in Laravel?"
    answer: "419 (Page Expired) is CSRF-specific: the CSRF token is missing, invalid, or session expired. Fix by adding @csrf to forms, checking SESSION_DOMAIN/SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE settings, or excluding API routes from VerifyCsrfToken. 500 (Internal Server Error) is generic PHP/Laravel errors--syntax errors, undefined variables, database errors, missing configs. Check storage/logs/laravel.log for the actual exception. 419 is always authentication/session issue; 500 requires reading logs to identify root cause. Both can appear if APP_DEBUG=false hides the real error."
  - question: "How can I prevent errors in production before they happen?"
    answer: "Implement pre-deployment checks: run php artisan test to ensure tests pass, use static analysis with PHPStan or Larastan (minimum level 5), validate environment with php artisan config:cache in staging, enable queue:work --tries=3 for resilience, set up error monitoring (Sentry/Bugsnag/Flare), implement health checks endpoint for monitoring, use Laravel Vapor/Forge for automated deployments with rollbacks, enable SQL query logging in staging to catch N+1 problems, require code reviews, and always test migrations in staging before production with identical data volumes."

Laravel applications fail for a handful of predictable reasons: missing or stale configuration, broken cache, database schema drift, misconfigured cookies, permissions, or plain coding mistakes. The sections below show fast, reliable ways to identify the root cause and ship a clean fix without guesswork.

<!--readmore-->

Start with a clean baseline
---------------------------
Run these commands from the project root to eliminate stale build artifacts before you investigate further:

```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
composer dump-autoload -o
```

When the problem is related to file permissions (very common after deploy), follow the safe defaults in this companion article: [Fix Laravel Permission Issues]({{< relref "blog/laravel/fix-laravel-permission-issues-production.md" >}}).

1) “No application encryption key has been specified”
----------------------------------------------------
Cause: `APP_KEY` is empty, truncated, or the app is using a cached config from a previous environment.

Fix:
```bash
php artisan key:generate --force
php artisan config:clear && php artisan config:cache
```
Generate the key once and keep it stable across releases. Regenerating on a live site invalidates encrypted cookies and sessions.

2) 419 Page Expired or CSRF token mismatch
------------------------------------------
Cause: the session cookie is not sent back or expires too soon, the domain/secure flags are wrong, or a form is missing the token.

Checklist:
- Forms must include `@csrf`.
- On HTTPS, set `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true`.
- If you use subdomains, set `SESSION_DOMAIN=.example.com`.
- For cross‑site embeds, `SESSION_SAME_SITE=none` requires secure cookies.

See also the cookie and driver section in: [Fixing Laravel Session and Cache Issues]({{< relref "blog/laravel/fixing-laravel-session-cache-issues.md" >}}).

3) 403 Forbidden
----------------
Two very different sources:
- From Laravel: policies/gates or custom middleware deny the action. Verify policies are registered and the current user has the required ability.
- From the server: wrong document root (not `public/`), missing `try_files`, or permissions/SELinux in production. If it’s the server, check your Nginx/Apache config and file ownership. Reference: [Fix Laravel Permission Issues]({{< relref "blog/laravel/fix-laravel-permission-issues-production.md" >}}) and [Deploy Laravel to VPS with Nginx -- Complete Guide]({{< relref "blog/laravel/deploy-laravel-to-vps-with-nginx-complete-guide.md" >}}).

4) 404 Not Found or “Route [name] not defined.”
----------------------------------------------
Causes:
- Typo in route name or missing route import.
- Cached routes out of sync with code.
- Wrong HTTP verb.

Fix:
```bash
php artisan route:list | grep -i users
php artisan route:clear && php artisan route:cache
```
Confirm controller namespaces and route groups. Make sure HTTP verbs match the route definitions.

5) 500 Internal Server Error
----------------------------
This is a category, not a single error. Look at logs first:

```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

Common root causes and quick checks:
- Syntax/runtime errors: the stack trace points to the file and line.
- Config cache mismatch: `php artisan config:clear` and retry.
- Missing PHP extensions (mbstring, intl, pdo_*): install matching extensions for your PHP version.
- Permissions on `storage/` or `bootstrap/cache/`: fix ownership and mode, then retry caches.
- Wrong `.env` values not being read: see the environment section below.

6) “Class not found”, “Target class does not exist”, or autoload issues
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Causes: missing `composer install`, incorrect namespace, class renamed without updating references, or PSR‑4 path mismatch.

Fix:
```bash
composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
composer dump-autoload -o
```
Check `composer.json` for correct PSR‑4 paths, and confirm the namespace matches the filesystem.

7) SQLSTATE errors (e.g., Base table or view not found, Unknown column)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Causes: pending migrations, wrong connection, or mismatched schema between web and CLI.

Fix:
```bash
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan tinker
>>> DB::connection()->getDatabaseName()
```
Ensure the app, queue workers, and CLI all point to the same database. Verify credentials in `config/database.php` and your environment.

8) Storage and file errors (missing links, cannot write)
-------------------------------------------------------
Symptoms: 404 for uploaded files, `image not found`, `Unable to create directory`.

Fix:
```bash
php artisan storage:link
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache
sudo find storage bootstrap/cache -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
sudo find storage bootstrap/cache -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
```
Prefer group‑writable permissions over `777`. For production patterns, see: [Fix Laravel Permission Issues]({{< relref "blog/laravel/fix-laravel-permission-issues-production.md" >}}).

9) Environment values not applying after deploy
-----------------------------------------------
Cause: configuration was cached earlier and the app is still reading stale values. Another frequent trap is web requests vs CLI/workers using different environments.

Fix sequence:
```bash
php artisan cache:clear && php artisan config:clear && php artisan route:clear && php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:cache && php artisan route:cache && php artisan view:cache
php artisan queue:restart || true
```
Set environment variables at the process level (PHP‑FPM, systemd, or your container orchestrator) instead of editing `.env` manually on servers. Details: [Laravel Environment Configuration]({{< relref "blog/laravel/laravel-environment-configuration-env-issues.md" >}}).

10) 405 Method Not Allowed
--------------------------
Cause: the route exists but the HTTP method doesn’t match (GET vs POST), or middleware blocks the verb.

Fix:
```bash
php artisan route:list | grep -i your-endpoint
```
Check JavaScript calls and HTML forms to ensure they use the expected verb and include `_method` when necessary.

11) “Page works locally but not behind a proxy or load balancer”
---------------------------------------------------------------
Cause: trusted proxy headers not configured, HTTPS offloading, or sticky sessions disabled.

Fix:
```php
// app/Http/Middleware/TrustProxies.php
protected $proxies = '*';
protected $headers = \Illuminate\Http\Request::HEADER_X_FORWARDED_AWS_ELB; // or HEADER_X_FORWARDED_ALL
```
Restart workers after changing environment or config:
```bash
php artisan queue:restart
```

12) “CORS policy” errors for APIs
---------------------------------
Cause: browser blocks cross‑origin requests. Configure allowed origins and headers.

Quick check: publish the CORS config (`config/cors.php`) and set allowed origins for your environments. Ensure preflight requests (OPTIONS) are handled by your server.

What to look for in logs
------------------------
Laravel’s application log usually has the answer. If the file is empty during a 500, check the PHP‑FPM and web server logs to catch fatal errors before Laravel handles them.

```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
sudo journalctl -u php8.2-fpm -f
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

For stronger diagnostics and clean log patterns in production, see: [Advanced Laravel Debugging with Logs]({{< relref "blog/laravel/advanced-laravel-debugging-with-logs.md" >}}).

A dependable release routine
----------------------------
Small, repeatable steps prevent most production incidents:

```bash
composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan cache:clear && php artisan config:clear && php artisan route:clear && php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:cache && php artisan route:cache && php artisan view:cache
php artisan queue:restart || true
sudo systemctl reload php8.2-fpm || true
```

Summary
-------
Resolve Laravel errors quickly by checking configuration cache, environment values, routes, migrations, file storage, and permissions first. Read the application log, then confirm server logs when needed. Keep releases predictable, restart workers after changes, and serve the app from `public/` with correct ownership and modes. With these habits in place, most 419/403/404/500 incidents become straightforward to diagnose and fix.
