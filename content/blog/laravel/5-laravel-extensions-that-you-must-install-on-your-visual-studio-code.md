faq:
  - question: "What's the difference between PHP Intelephense and PHP IntelliSense?"
    answer: "PHP Intelephense is the superior, actively maintained extension that replaced the older PHP IntelliSense. Key differences: (1) Performance—Intelephense indexes faster and uses less memory, handles large codebases better. (2) Features—Intelephense supports full PHP 8.x syntax, better namespace resolution, workspace symbol search, go-to-definition for Composer packages. (3) Accuracy—Intelephense's type inference is more accurate, understands PHPDoc types, supports generics. (4) Maintenance—Intelephense actively updated monthly, PHP IntelliSense deprecated. (5) Licensing—Intelephense free for most features, premium ($15 lifetime) adds rename refactoring and advanced features. Install: Disable/uninstall built-in PHP IntelliSense, install Intelephense. Settings: add to settings.json: 'intelephense.files.maxSize': 5000000 for large projects. For Laravel specifically, pair with Laravel Extra Intellisense for facades/route autocomplete."
  - question: "Do I need Laravel IDE Helper if I use these extensions?"
    answer: "Yes, Laravel IDE Helper complements VSCode extensions—they solve different problems. Extensions provide UI/UX features (snippets, navigation, Artisan commands in palette), while IDE Helper generates PHPDoc annotations that help ANY IDE understand Laravel magic. Benefits of IDE Helper: (1) Facade autocomplete—generates docblocks so $request->user() shows available methods. (2) Model hints—php artisan ide-helper:models generates @property annotations: User model shows $user->name, $user->email. (3) Meta file—generates _ide_helper.php with full facade/helper definitions. Install: composer require --dev barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper, add to post-update-cmd in composer.json. Generate: php artisan ide-helper:generate && php artisan ide-helper:models -N. Best setup: Laravel IDE Helper (docblocks) + PHP Intelephense (PHP parsing) + Laravel Extra Intellisense (Laravel-specific) = perfect autocomplete. IDE Helper works in PHPStorm too, making it team-friendly."
  - question: "Which is better for Laravel: VSCode or PHPStorm?"
    answer: "PHPStorm is more powerful but expensive, VSCode is free and fast. PHPStorm advantages: (1) Laravel built-in support—understands facades, routes, Blade without plugins. (2) Advanced refactoring—rename variables across project, extract methods safely. (3) Database tools—query databases directly in IDE. (4) Debugging—Xdebug setup easier, better UI. (5) Code quality—built-in inspections, type hints, static analysis. (6) All-in-one—Git, terminal, composer, npm in unified interface. Costs $199/year ($89 first year). VSCode advantages: (1) Free and open source. (2) Fast startup—PHPStorm takes 10-30s, VSCode instant. (3) Lightweight—uses less RAM (500MB vs 2GB). (4) Extensions—huge ecosystem, customize anything. (5) Web-friendly—better for JavaScript/TypeScript/CSS. Recommendation: Beginners → VSCode (free, easier learning curve). Professional teams → PHPStorm (productivity boost worth the cost). Freelancers → VSCode + Intelephense Premium ($15) for 90% of PHPStorm features. Try PHPStorm free for 30 days—if it improves your workflow significantly, buy it. Many devs use VSCode for small edits, PHPStorm for serious work."
  - question: "How do I configure VSCode settings.json for optimal Laravel development?"
    answer: "Essential settings for Laravel in .vscode/settings.json: {'files.associations': {'*.blade.php': 'blade'}, 'emmet.includeLanguages': {'blade': 'html'}, 'blade.format.enable': true, 'intelephense.files.associations': ['*.php', '*.blade.php'], 'intelephense.files.exclude': ['**/vendor/**', '**/storage/**', '**/node_modules/**'], '[php]': {'editor.defaultFormatter': 'bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client', 'editor.formatOnSave': true}, '[blade]': {'editor.defaultFormatter': 'shufo.vscode-blade-formatter', 'editor.formatOnSave': true}, 'php.suggest.basic': false, 'php.validate.enable': false}. Install Blade Formatter extension for auto-formatting. Add to workspace: 'intelephense.environment.phpVersion': '8.2.0' to match project PHP. For Prettier integration: install Prettier extension, add 'prettier.enable': true. Performance boost: increase 'intelephense.files.maxSize': 5000000 for large projects. Share settings: commit .vscode/settings.json so team uses same config."
  - question: "What are other essential VSCode extensions beyond these 5 for Laravel development?"
    answer: "Additional must-have extensions: (1) Laravel Blade Formatter (shufo)—auto-format Blade files with consistent indentation, better than manual formatting. (2) DotENV (mikestead)—syntax highlighting for .env files, prevents typos in env vars. (3) Better Comments (aaron-bond)—color-code comments: // TODO, // FIXME, // NOTE. (4) Error Lens (usernamehw)—display errors inline instead of hover, see bugs immediately. (5) GitLens (eamodio)—git blame, history, compare—essential for team projects. (6) Prettier + Prettier PHP—format PHP, JS, CSS consistently. (7) Tailwind CSS IntelliSense—if using Tailwind (common in Laravel). (8) Todo Tree (gruntfuggly)—find all TODO comments across project. (9) PHP Debug (xdebug)—debug PHP with breakpoints. (10) Remote SSH—edit files on server directly. Optional but useful: Docker extension (if using Docker), REST Client (test APIs without Postman), Code Spell Checker (catch typos). Don't over-install: too many extensions slow VSCode. Start with core 5-10, add as needed."
  - question: "How do I use Laravel Artisan extension effectively in VSCode?"
    answer: "Laravel Artisan extension adds Artisan commands to Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P). Usage: (1) Open palette → type 'Artisan' → see all commands. (2) Quick scaffolding: 'Artisan: Make Controller' → enter name → creates controller instantly. (3) Run migrations: 'Artisan: Migrate' runs without switching to terminal. (4) Clear caches: 'Artisan: Clear Cache' → quick cleanup. (5) Custom commands: add your commands to artisan, extension auto-detects them. Tips: (1) Keybindings—assign shortcuts for frequent commands: Cmd+K Cmd+M for migrate. (2) Output panel—shows Artisan command results in VSCode output. (3) Input prompts—extension prompts for required arguments (controller name, model name). Limitations: (1) Can't pass complex arguments—use terminal for advanced flags. (2) No autocomplete for argument values. (3) Sometimes lags on large projects. Alternatives: use integrated terminal (Ctrl+`) for full control, Artisan extension for quick common tasks. Best practice: learn common Artisan commands, use extension as shortcut, terminal for complex tasks."
