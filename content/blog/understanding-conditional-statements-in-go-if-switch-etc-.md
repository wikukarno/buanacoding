Understanding Conditional Statements in Go (if, switch, etc.)
=============================================================

Conditional statements are one of the essential building blocks in any programming language, including Go. They allow us to make decisions in our code — telling the program to do something only if a certain condition is true.

In this article, we will explore:

*   The if, else, and else if statements
*   The switch statement
*   Best practices for using conditionals in Go
*   Real examples to help you practice

What is a Conditional Statement?
--------------------------------

A conditional statement evaluates whether a condition is true or false. Based on that, your Go program can choose which block of code to execute.

Let’s say you want your app to greet users differently depending on the time of day. That’s where conditional logic comes in!

if, else if, and else
---------------------

The most common conditional structure is if.

### Basic if syntax:

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    age := 20

    if age >= 18 {
        fmt.Println("You are an adult.")
    }
} 
```

### With else:

```
func main() {
    age := 15

    if age >= 18 {
        fmt.Println("You are an adult.")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("You are underage.")
    }
} 
```

### With else if:

```
func main() {
    hour := 14

    if hour < 12 {
        fmt.Println("Good morning!")
    } else if hour < 18 {
        fmt.Println("Good afternoon!")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Good evening!")
    }
} 
```

You can use multiple else if statements to check different conditions.

Short if Statement
------------------

Go supports a shorter form to declare variables inside the if block:

```
func main() {
    if num := 10; num%2 == 0 {
        fmt.Println("Even number")
    }
} 
```

This is useful if you only need the variable inside the if scope.

switch Statement
----------------

The switch statement lets you compare a value against multiple conditions. It's a cleaner alternative to many else if blocks.

### Example:

```
func main() {
    day := "Friday"

    switch day {
    case "Monday":
        fmt.Println("Start of the week!")
    case "Friday":
        fmt.Println("Almost weekend!")
    case "Saturday", "Sunday":
        fmt.Println("Weekend time!")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Another day!")
    }
} 
```

You can also group cases like Saturday and Sunday above.

Best Practices for Beginners
----------------------------

*   Keep your condition logic simple.
*   Prefer switch when comparing one variable to multiple values.
*   Don't forget the default case in switch.
*   Avoid deep nesting (e.g. if-inside-if-inside-if).

More Practice Examples
----------------------

### 1\. Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero:

```
func main() {
    num := 0

    if num > 0 {
        fmt.Println("Positive")
    } else if num < 0 {
        fmt.Println("Negative")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Zero")
    }
} 
```

### 2\. Simple login simulation:

```
func main() {
    username := "admin"
    password := "1234"

    if username == "admin" && password == "1234" {
        fmt.Println("Login successful")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Invalid credentials")
    }
} 
```

Conclusion
----------

Understanding how conditionals work in Go helps you control the flow of your programs. Start with if and else, and move on to switch when you need to compare multiple options. Use these tools to build dynamic and interactive applications.
