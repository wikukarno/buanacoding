faq:
  - question: "Do AI coding assistants replace the need to learn programming?"
    answer: "No, AI coding assistants are tools that enhance productivity, not replacements for programming knowledge. They're most effective when you understand what you're trying to build and can evaluate their suggestions. Think of them as autocomplete on steroids – they accelerate development but require you to understand code fundamentals, system design, and problem-solving. Beginners should learn core concepts first, then use AI assistants to speed up implementation."
  - question: "Which AI coding assistant is best for beginners on a budget?"
    answer: "Codeium offers the best free tier for beginners with no usage limits and support for 70+ languages. GitHub Copilot ($10/month) is also excellent for learning as it provides context-aware suggestions with good documentation. For students, many AI assistants offer free access or educational discounts. Start with Codeium's free version to understand how AI assistance works, then consider paid options once you see the value."
  - question: "Are AI coding assistants safe to use with proprietary company code?"
    answer: "It depends on the tool and your configuration. Tabnine offers on-premise deployment with local processing for maximum privacy. GitHub Copilot Business has enterprise features with code exclusions and privacy controls. Amazon CodeWhisperer provides security scanning and compliance features. Always check your company's security policies, use business/enterprise versions for work projects, and avoid free versions that may use your code for training without proper safeguards."
  - question: "Can I use multiple AI coding assistants simultaneously?"
    answer: "Yes, many developers use different AI assistants for different purposes. For example, GitHub Copilot for general development, CodeWhisperer for AWS projects, and Cursor for complex refactoring. However, running multiple AI extensions simultaneously can cause conflicts or performance issues. It's better to enable specific tools for specific projects rather than having all active at once. Most IDEs allow you to disable extensions per workspace."
  - question: "How much productivity improvement can I expect from AI coding assistants?"
    answer: "Studies show developers using AI assistants complete tasks 55% faster on average. However, actual improvement varies based on task type, experience level, and how well you integrate the tool into your workflow. Maximum benefits come from repetitive tasks (CRUD operations, boilerplate code, API integrations) rather than complex algorithmic problems. Expect a learning curve of 1-2 weeks before seeing significant productivity gains."
  - question: "What are the main differences between GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer?"
    answer: "GitHub Copilot excels at general-purpose coding across all languages with superior context awareness and IDE integration, costing $10/month. Amazon CodeWhisperer specializes in AWS development with built-in security scanning, offering a generous free tier and AWS-optimized code generation. Choose Copilot for broad development needs; choose CodeWhisperer if you work primarily with AWS services or want a free option with security focus."
