faq:
  - question: "Is it safe to store all my passwords in one password manager?"
    answer: "Yes, when using reputable password managers. Your vault is encrypted with a master password using AES-256 or similar strong encryption. The encryption happens locally before syncing, so even the password manager company cannot read your data. Enable 2FA on your vault, use a strong master password, and choose established providers like Bitwarden, 1Password, or KeePassXC. The risk of password reuse far exceeds the risk of using a password manager."
  - question: "What happens if I forget my master password?"
    answer: "Most password managers cannot recover your master password due to zero-knowledge encryption—they don't have the decryption key. You'll lose access to your vault unless you saved recovery codes or set up account recovery options beforehand. That's why it's critical to write down your master password and store it securely (safe, lockbox) until memorized. Some managers like 1Password offer emergency kits; print and secure them immediately after setup."
  - question: "Should I use a cloud-based or local password manager?"
    answer: "Cloud-based managers (Bitwarden, 1Password, Proton Pass) offer seamless sync across devices, automatic backups, and easier family sharing—ideal for most users. Local managers (KeePassXC) give you full control, no cloud dependency, and work well if you manage your own sync (iCloud Drive, Syncthing). Choose cloud for convenience and built-in sync; choose local if you're comfortable with manual sync and want absolute control over your data."
  - question: "Can I share passwords securely with family or team members?"
    answer: "Yes, most password managers offer secure sharing features. Bitwarden has Organizations and Collections, 1Password offers Families and Teams plans with shared vaults, and Proton Pass supports secure sharing within the Proton ecosystem. Shared items remain encrypted and can be revoked anytime. Never share passwords via email, messaging apps, or documents—always use your password manager's built-in sharing to maintain encryption and access control."
  - question: "How do I switch from one password manager to another?"
    answer: "Export your vault from the old manager (usually as CSV or JSON from settings), then import into the new manager. Before deleting the old vault, verify all logins imported correctly and test a few critical accounts. Enable 2FA on the new manager immediately. Delete the exported file after import to avoid leaving unencrypted passwords on your system. Most managers support importing from common competitors, making migration straightforward."
  - question: "Do I need to pay for a password manager?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. Bitwarden's free tier is excellent for individuals with unlimited passwords, cross-device sync, and core security features. Paid tiers ($10-40/year) add TOTP generation, vault health reports, emergency access, and priority support. 1Password requires a subscription but offers polished UX and advanced family features. KeePassXC is completely free. Start with a free option like Bitwarden; upgrade if you need premium features like advanced reporting or family vaults."

If you reuse passwords, the internet is quietly stacking odds against you. One small site gets breached, your email and password leak, and attackers try the same combo on your email, banking, cloud storage—everywhere. That “I’ll remember it” system works right up until it doesn’t. The fix isn’t superhuman memory; it’s outsourcing the problem to a tool designed for it: a password manager.

What a password manager actually does

- Generates strong, unique passwords for every account
- Stores them encrypted, synced across your devices
- Auto‑fills only on the correct websites/apps
- Audits your vault for weak/reused/compromised passwords
- Holds secure notes, TOTP codes (in some apps), and sometimes passkeys

The goal is simple: every account gets its own high‑entropy secret, and you never type or remember it again.

Recommended apps (pick one that fits you)

- Bitwarden (Free + Premium): Open‑source, great value, works on all platforms and browsers, supports organizations/families, and has excellent import/export. Paid tier adds TOTP, vault health, and more. A strong “default choice” for most people.
- 1Password (Paid): Polished UX, excellent security model (Secret Key + Master Password), great families features, best‑in‑class browser integration. If you want something that “just feels nice” and you’re okay paying, it’s hard to beat.
- Proton Pass (Free + Paid): From the Proton team (Mail/Drive/VPN). Simple, privacy‑centric, integrated with Proton ecosystem, passkey support. Good if you already live in Proton land.
- KeePassXC (Free, local): No cloud, full control. Great for people who want local files + their own sync (e.g., iCloud Drive, Syncthing). More hands‑on, but beloved by power users.

Quick decision guide

- I want the best free cross‑platform option: Bitwarden
- I want the smoothest family experience: 1Password Families
- I want privacy + Proton ecosystem: Proton Pass
- I want local/no cloud: KeePassXC (plus a sync method you trust)

How to migrate in a weekend (no overwhelm)

1) Choose your manager and install across your devices
- Install the desktop app and browser extension (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge).
- Install the mobile app. Enable biometrics for convenience (your face/fingerprint is only a local unlock—your master password still matters).

2) Create a strong master password
- Use a long passphrase (5–6 random words, with separators). Length beats cleverness.
- Don’t reuse this anywhere else. Write it down once and store it in a safe or lockbox until you’ve memorized it.

3) Turn on 2FA for your password manager
- Use an authenticator app (or hardware key) to protect your vault login.

4) Import existing logins
- Export from your browser’s saved passwords (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari) or your old manager. Import into the new vault. Then disable the browser’s built‑in password saving to avoid duplicates/confusion.

5) Set your generator defaults
- 20+ characters, random, include symbols, avoid ambiguous characters. For sites that reject long passwords (it happens), drop to 16—never reuse an old one.

6) Fix the crown jewels first
- Email, primary phone account, banking, cloud storage, Apple/Google/Microsoft IDs, domain registrars, developer platforms (GitHub, GitLab). Rotate these passwords immediately and enable 2FA.

7) Enable passkeys where available
- Many sites now support passkeys (phishing‑resistant, no password to steal). Your manager or platform (iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager) can store them. Use passkeys when you can; keep a password fallback when you must.

8) Clean up and audit
- Run the vault health check (Bitwarden/1Password/Proton Pass) to spot reused/weak/compromised passwords. Replace a handful each day until the list is clean.

9) Back up recovery options
- Save recovery codes for critical accounts (email, cloud, banks). Store them offline. If your manager offers an emergency kit (1Password), print it and keep it safe.

10) New habit: let the manager do the typing
- On sign‑up screens, use “Generate password” and save. On login, auto‑fill from the extension or app. If you ever type a password by hand, it’s a smell.

Simple rules that keep you safe long‑term

- One master password to rule them all—never reuse it.
- 2FA everywhere it matters (email first, then banks, then social/dev tools).
- Unique passwords for every account, no exceptions.
- Don’t store 2FA codes in the same place as passwords for high‑value targets (email, banking). Split risk—use a separate authenticator or a security key.
- Treat SMS 2FA as the last resort; prefer authenticator apps or hardware keys.
- Be picky about browser auto‑fill prompts. If your manager doesn’t light up on a page, double‑check the URL. Phishing relies on rushed clicks.

What about “my browser already saves passwords”?

Browsers have improved, but dedicated managers still win on cross‑platform support, breach monitoring, secure sharing, granular vaults, and recovery workflows. If you’re deep in one platform (e.g., only Apple devices), iCloud Keychain + passkeys is fine—but for most mixed setups, Bitwarden/1Password/Proton Pass give you fewer sharp edges.

Threats this actually addresses

- Credential stuffing: Unique passwords stop attackers from reusing a leaked password elsewhere.
- Phishing: Managers auto‑fill only on the right domain; passkeys resist phishing by design.
- Weak/guessable passwords: Generators create high‑entropy secrets that aren’t in any wordlist.

Things this does not solve (and what to do)

- Malware on your device: Keep OS and browser updated, don’t install sketchy extensions, and scan if anything feels off.
- Public Wi‑Fi interception: Use HTTPS (default) and a reputable VPN if you must use untrusted networks.
- Account recovery traps: Keep recovery emails/phones current; store backup codes offline.

Quick Action Steps

- Install a manager on desktop + phone
- Set a long master passphrase and enable 2FA on the vault
- Import your browser’s saved passwords
- Rotate the password on your email + cloud + bank
- Disable browser password saving, keep only the manager

You don’t need to fix your entire digital life in one night—just stop the worst risk: reuse. Move your important accounts now, chip away at the rest, and let the tool do the heavy lifting. In a week, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without the “Generate” button.
