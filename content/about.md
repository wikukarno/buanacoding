# Hi, I'm Wiku Karno! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to **BuanaCoding** â€“ where I share my journey as a software developer and help others build better applications through practical tutorials and real-world insights.

## What I Do

I'm a passionate software developer who loves diving deep into modern programming languages and frameworks. My expertise spans across several key areas:

### **Go Programming**
Go is my primary language of choice. I've written extensively about Go fundamentals, advanced concepts like goroutines and channels, building REST APIs, working with databases, and following Go best practices. Whether you're just starting with Go or looking to level up your skills, you'll find comprehensive guides here.

### **Web Development**
I specialize in full-stack web development using:
- **Laravel/PHP** for robust web applications
- **Python/FastAPI** for high-performance APIs
- Modern development practices and clean architecture

### **DevOps & Linux**
System administration and deployment are crucial skills for any developer. I share tutorials on:
- Linux server management and troubleshooting
- Docker containerization
- Nginx configuration and SSL setup
- Application deployment strategies

### **Security & Best Practices**
Security isn't an afterthought â€“ it's built into everything I do. I cover topics like:
- Web application security
- Password management and authentication
- Modern authentication methods (Passkeys, WebAuthn)
- Protecting against common security threats

### **Developer Productivity**
I'm always exploring tools and techniques that make developers more productive:
- Code editors and essential extensions
- Development environment setup
- Automation and workflow optimization

## My Mission

**BuanaCoding** exists to bridge the gap between complex technical concepts and practical, actionable knowledge. I believe that:

- **Learning should be accessible** â€“ I write for developers at all levels, from beginners to experienced professionals
- **Real-world examples matter** â€“ Every tutorial includes practical examples you can actually use in your projects
- **Quality over quantity** â€“ I focus on creating comprehensive, well-researched content rather than quick tips
- **Community drives growth** â€“ The best learning happens when we share knowledge and learn from each other

## Why Trust My Content?

I don't just write about technologies â€“ I use them in real projects. Every tutorial and guide is based on hands-on experience, tested solutions, and lessons learned from actual development work.

My content has helped thousands of developers:
- Learn Go programming from scratch to advanced concepts
- Build secure web applications with Laravel and FastAPI
- Deploy applications to production servers
- Implement modern security practices
- Optimize their development workflows
