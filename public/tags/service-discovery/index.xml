Your database lived at &lt;code&gt;localhost:5432&lt;/code&gt;, your cache at &lt;code&gt;localhost:6379&lt;/code&gt;, and everything was predictable. But when you move to microservices, suddenly you have dozens of services spinning up and down across multiple servers, and nobody knows where anything is anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where service discovery becomes your lifeline. Instead of hardcoding addresses and hoping for the best, you get a dynamic phone book that keeps track of who&amp;rsquo;s available, where they live, and whether they&amp;rsquo;re actually working. After building several distributed systems in Go, I can tell you that getting service discovery right is often the difference between a system that scales gracefully and one that becomes an operational nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
