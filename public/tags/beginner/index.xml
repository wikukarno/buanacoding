That&amp;rsquo;s computer vision at work, and honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s not as complicated as it looks. When I first managed to get a webcam to detect my face in real-time, I was blown away. It felt like I&amp;rsquo;d just taught my computer to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crazy thing is, you can build this stuff yourself. No PhD required, no expensive equipment - just Python, OpenCV, and some patience. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with computer vision for a few years now, and I still get excited every time I see a detection algorithm actually work on messy, real-world data.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>gRPC in Go Complete Guide from Basics to Production Ready Services</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/grpc-in-go-complete-guide-from-basics-to-production.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/grpc-in-go-complete-guide-from-basics-to-production.html</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Building modern distributed systems is tricky business - you need services that can talk to each other quickly and reliably. That&amp;rsquo;s where gRPC comes in and absolutely crushes it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been building REST APIs for years, but when I first tried gRPC, it was like switching from a bicycle to a sports car. The speed difference is insane, plus you get type safety and can use it with practically any programming language.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>FastAPI Tutorial Build REST API from Scratch (Beginner Guide)</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/fastapi-tutorial-build-rest-api-from-scratch-beginner-guide.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 07:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/fastapi-tutorial-build-rest-api-from-scratch-beginner-guide.html</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Building APIs used to scare me when I first started programming. There&amp;rsquo;s so much to learn - databases, HTTP methods, authentication, error handling. But FastAPI changed everything for me. It&amp;rsquo;s like having training wheels that actually make you faster, not slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to build a real Book Library API from the ground up. No fluff, no complicated setups - just practical, working code that you can understand and expand on. By the end of this guide, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a fully functional REST API that can handle creating, reading, updating, and deleting books.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Git Commands Cheat Sheet: 50+ Commands Every Developer Must Know</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/01/git-commands-cheat-sheet-every-developer-must-know.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 12:30:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/01/git-commands-cheat-sheet-every-developer-must-know.html</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ever been in the middle of coding and suddenly forgot that one Git command you needed? Or confused about when to use &lt;code&gt;git reset&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;git revert&lt;/code&gt;? Yeah, we&amp;rsquo;ve all been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put together this cheat sheet as a quick reference you can bookmark. It has 50+ Git commands I actually use on a daily basis - from the basics to some advanced stuff. No fluff, just the commands and what they do.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
