That&amp;rsquo;s where gRPC comes in and absolutely crushes it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been building REST APIs for years, but when I first tried gRPC, it was like switching from a bicycle to a sports car. The speed difference is insane, plus you get type safety and can use it with practically any programming language.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FastAPI Tutorial: Build REST API from Scratch (Beginner Guide)</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/fastapi-tutorial-build-rest-api-from-scratch-beginner-guide.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 07:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/fastapi-tutorial-build-rest-api-from-scratch-beginner-guide.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Building APIs used to scare me when I first started programming. There&amp;rsquo;s so much to learn - databases, HTTP methods, authentication, error handling. But FastAPI changed everything for me. It&amp;rsquo;s like having training wheels that actually make you faster, not slower.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re going to build a real Book Library API from the ground up. No fluff, no complicated setups - just practical, working code that you can understand and expand on. By the end of this guide, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a fully functional REST API that can handle creating, reading, updating, and deleting books.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
