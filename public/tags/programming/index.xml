How Developers Actually Build Software with AI in 2026</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2026/02/what-is-vibe-coding-ai-powered-development-guide.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 09:07:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2026/02/what-is-vibe-coding-ai-powered-development-guide.html</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been on tech Twitter, Reddit, or any developer forum in the past year, you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the term &lt;strong&gt;vibe coding&lt;/strong&gt; thrown around constantly. Some people swear by it. Others think it&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of the end for &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; programming. And a lot of developers are quietly using it every day without making a big deal about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last several months going deep into vibe coding workflows, and I want to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: what it actually is, where it works well, where it completely falls apart, and what this all means if you write code for a living.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Developer Roadmap 2025: Skills You Need to Get Hired</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/11/developer-roadmap-2025-skills-you-need-to-get-hired.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 08:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/11/developer-roadmap-2025-skills-you-need-to-get-hired.html</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Let me be blunt: the developer job market in 2025 is different from what it was three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI tools are everywhere. Companies are pickier. Junior roles are competitive. And yet, software development jobs are projected to grow 17% through 2033 — way faster than most careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers who struggle? They&amp;rsquo;re learning outdated skills, skipping fundamentals, or drowning in tutorial hell without ever building real projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers who get hired? They understand what companies actually need, focus on the right skills, and prove they can build things that work.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Best Programming Language to Learn in 2025 for Beginners</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/11/best-programming-language-to-learn-in-2025-for-beginners.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 07:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/11/best-programming-language-to-learn-in-2025-for-beginners.html</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to learn programming. Smart move. But now you&amp;rsquo;re stuck staring at a list of languages that sounds like alphabet soup — Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust — and wondering which one won&amp;rsquo;t make you want to throw your laptop out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been there. And I&amp;rsquo;ve watched countless beginners get paralyzed by this exact decision, spending weeks researching instead of actually coding. Here&amp;rsquo;s the truth: the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; language depends entirely on what you want to build and where you want to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>10 Best AI Coding Assistants Every Developer Should Try in 2025</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/10-best-ai-coding-assistants-every-developer-should-try-2025.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 15:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/10-best-ai-coding-assistants-every-developer-should-try-2025.html</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The way we write code is changing dramatically. AI coding assistants have moved from experimental tools to essential companions that can genuinely transform your development workflow. I&amp;rsquo;ve been testing AI coding tools since they first emerged, and honestly, the progress in 2025 has been mind-blowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What used to take hours of debugging, researching documentation, or writing boilerplate code can now be done in minutes. But with so many AI coding assistants flooding the market, choosing the right one feels overwhelming. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve spent months testing every major AI coding tool to bring you this comprehensive guide.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
