      <description>&lt;p&gt;APIs power modern applications by exposing functionality to clients, but unrestricted access creates vulnerabilities. A single misbehaving client can overwhelm your server, degrading performance for all users. Malicious actors can exploit unprotected endpoints to scrape data, attempt credential stuffing, or launch denial of service attacks. Rate limiting provides the first line of defense against these threats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive guide demonstrates how to implement rate limiting in Go applications. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn multiple algorithms including token bucket and sliding window approaches, build middleware for automatic request throttling, implement per-IP and per-user limiting strategies, integrate Redis for distributed systems, and follow production best practices for protecting your APIs effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re building distributed systems, one component stands between chaos and order: the API Gateway. Think of it as the bouncer at an exclusive club - it decides who gets in, where they go, and how fast they can enter. After working with various microservice architectures, I can tell you that a well-implemented API Gateway is often the difference between a system that scales gracefully and one that crumbles under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
