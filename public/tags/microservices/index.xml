      <description>&lt;p&gt;Building modern distributed systems is tricky business - you need services that can talk to each other quickly and reliably. That&amp;rsquo;s where gRPC comes in and absolutely crushes it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been building REST APIs for years, but when I first tried gRPC, it was like switching from a bicycle to a sports car. The speed difference is insane, plus you get type safety and can use it with practically any programming language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
