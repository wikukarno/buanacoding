Nobody wants to download 10,000 records just to find a few items. This guide shows you how to add pagination, filtering, sorting, and search to your Laravel REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll learn Laravel&amp;rsquo;s built-in pagination methods, how to add query parameters for filters and sorting, search across multiple columns, cursor pagination for large datasets, and API resources for formatting responses. We&amp;rsquo;ll also cover performance tips and common mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to Send Emails in Go - SMTP, SendGrid, and Mailgun Integration</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/10/how-to-send-emails-in-go-smtp-sendgrid-mailgun.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 18:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/10/how-to-send-emails-in-go-smtp-sendgrid-mailgun.html</guid><description>&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your application needs to send emails. Welcome messages after signup, password reset links, order confirmations, notification alerts. Email is still the most reliable way to reach users, but sending emails programmatically is harder than it looks.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to Implement Background Jobs in Go with Asynq and Redis</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/10/how-to-implement-background-jobs-in-go-with-asynq-and-redis.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/10/how-to-implement-background-jobs-in-go-with-asynq-and-redis.html</guid><description>&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your API is slow. Not because the code is inefficient, but because you&amp;rsquo;re doing too much in the HTTP request cycle. Sending emails, processing images, generating reports - all blocking the response while the user waits. That&amp;rsquo;s not how you scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to Profile and Optimize Go Applications with pprof</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/10/how-to-profile-and-optimize-go-applications-with-pprof.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/10/how-to-profile-and-optimize-go-applications-with-pprof.html</guid><description>&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Go application is slow. Requests take too long, memory usage keeps climbing, or CPU maxes out under load. You need answers, not guesses.

&lt;p&gt;Managing database schema changes is one of those tasks that seems simple until you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with multiple environments, team members making conflicting changes, or trying to rollback a production deployment at 2 AM. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever manually run SQL scripts on production hoping you didn&amp;rsquo;t miss anything, you know exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to Upload Files to AWS S3 in Go Complete Guide with SDK v2</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/10/how-to-upload-files-to-aws-s3-in-go-with-sdk-v2.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/10/how-to-upload-files-to-aws-s3-in-go-with-sdk-v2.html</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve built any real application, you know file storage becomes a problem fast. User avatars, document uploads, video files - they pile up quickly, and you need somewhere reliable to put them. That&amp;rsquo;s where AWS S3 comes in. It&amp;rsquo;s like having unlimited storage that you only pay for what you use, and it integrates beautifully with Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS recently rewrote their entire Go SDK with v2, and honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s a massive improvement. Cleaner APIs, better error handling, proper context support - everything you&amp;rsquo;d want in a modern Go library. If you&amp;rsquo;re starting fresh or thinking about upgrading from v1, this guide has you covered.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
