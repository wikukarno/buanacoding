And most of us are still using tools written in the 1970s and 80s — &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;. They work, sure. But they were designed for a time when terminals had 24 rows and 80 columns, file systems were tiny, and nobody expected colored output or Unicode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime in the last few years, people started building modern replacements. Mostly in Rust, some in Go. They&amp;rsquo;re faster, they have sane defaults, and they produce output you can actually read without squinting. I&amp;rsquo;ve been swapping out the classics one by one, and at this point I can&amp;rsquo;t go back.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
