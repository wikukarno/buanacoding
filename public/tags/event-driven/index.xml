Event-driven architecture gives you a better way to build systems by letting components talk to each other through messages instead of direct calls. When combined with Go&amp;rsquo;s excellent concurrency model and robust ecosystem, event-driven systems become powerful tools for building scalable, resilient applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to build event-driven systems using Go and message queues that actually work in production. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore event sourcing patterns, CQRS implementation, and practical strategies for building systems that can handle high throughput while maintaining data consistency and system reliability.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
