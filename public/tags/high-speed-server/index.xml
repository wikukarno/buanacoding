Think of it as giving your application a turbo boost - we&amp;rsquo;re talking about performance gains that can make your app 3x to 10x faster in many scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laravel Octane takes your regular Laravel application and runs it on high-performance application servers like Swoole or RoadRunner. Instead of booting up your entire application for every single request (which is what traditional PHP does), Octane keeps your app loaded in memory and reuses it for multiple requests. The result? Lightning-fast response times that will make your users happy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
