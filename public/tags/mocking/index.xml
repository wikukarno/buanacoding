When your code depends on databases, external APIs, or other services, testing becomes complex and slow. Mock testing solves this by replacing real dependencies with controlled fake implementations, allowing you to test your code quickly without external systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide demonstrates how to implement effective mock testing in Go using Testify and Mockery. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn to design testable code with interfaces, generate mocks automatically with Mockery, write assertions with Testify, verify method calls and return values, implement table-driven mock tests, and follow best practices that create maintainable test suites without over-mocking.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
