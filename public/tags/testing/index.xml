Laravel makes testing easy with built-in support for PHPUnit and Pest. You write tests that run your code and check the results match what you expect. When you change something, run the tests to make sure nothing broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide shows you how to set up testing in Laravel, write feature tests for HTTP endpoints, write unit tests for business logic, test databases with factories, mock external services, test APIs, and integrate tests into your deployment pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to Implement CI/CD for Go Applications with GitHub Actions</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/10/how-to-implement-cicd-for-go-applications-with-github-actions.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 11:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/10/how-to-implement-cicd-for-go-applications-with-github-actions.html</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Manual deployments are error-prone and time-consuming. You make a change, run tests locally, build the binary, SSH into servers, copy files, restart services, and hope nothing breaks. Multiply this by ten deployments per day and you&amp;rsquo;ve wasted hours on repetitive tasks that should be automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide demonstrates how to implement CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) for Go applications using GitHub Actions. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn to create automated workflows that test code on every push, build optimized binaries for multiple platforms, deploy Docker containers automatically, cache dependencies for faster builds, and apply production-ready practices that catch bugs before users do.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to Use Mock Testing in Go with Testify and Mockery - Complete Guide</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/10/how-to-use-mock-testing-in-go-with-testify-and-mockery.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 09:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/10/how-to-use-mock-testing-in-go-with-testify-and-mockery.html</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Testing individual units of code in isolation is critical for building reliable software. When your code depends on databases, external APIs, or other services, testing becomes complex and slow. Mock testing solves this by replacing real dependencies with controlled fake implementations, allowing you to test your code quickly without external systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide demonstrates how to implement effective mock testing in Go using Testify and Mockery. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn to design testable code with interfaces, generate mocks automatically with Mockery, write assertions with Testify, verify method calls and return values, implement table-driven mock tests, and follow best practices that create maintainable test suites without over-mocking.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
