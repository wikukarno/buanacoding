&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookie-based auth for SPAs that live on the same top-level domain as your backend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal access tokens for mobile apps, third‑party clients, or server‑to‑server use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial walks through both flows end‑to‑end, including the necessary configuration (CORS, cookies, stateful domains), how to issue and revoke tokens, how to protect routes, and how to test the result. You’ll also find production notes to avoid common pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Computer Vision with OpenCV: Complete Guide to Object Detection and Face Recognition in Python</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/09/computer-vision-opencv-object-detection-face-recognition-tutorial.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/09/computer-vision-opencv-object-detection-face-recognition-tutorial.html</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered how your phone instantly recognizes your face to unlock, or how Tesla&amp;rsquo;s autopilot spots other cars on the highway? That&amp;rsquo;s computer vision at work, and honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s not as complicated as it looks. When I first managed to get a webcam to detect my face in real-time, I was blown away. It felt like I&amp;rsquo;d just taught my computer to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crazy thing is, you can build this stuff yourself. No PhD required, no expensive equipment - just Python, OpenCV, and some patience. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with computer vision for a few years now, and I still get excited every time I see a detection algorithm actually work on messy, real-world data.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Essential Linux Commands Every Developer Must Know in 2025</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/essential-linux-commands-every-developer-must-know-2025.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 10:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/essential-linux-commands-every-developer-must-know-2025.html</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re building web applications, managing servers, or working in DevOps, mastering Linux commands is absolutely essential for any developer in 2025. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Linux systems for years, and I can tell you that knowing the right commands at the right time can save you hours of work and make you incredibly productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux dominates the server world, powers most cloud infrastructure, and is the backbone of modern development environments. From managing &lt;a href="https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/install-docker-on-ubuntu-24-04-compose-v2-rootless.html"&gt;
 Docker containers
&lt;/a&gt;
 to setting up &lt;a href="https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/nginx-certbot-ubuntu-24-04-free-https.html"&gt;
 secure web servers with HTTPS
&lt;/a&gt;
, these commands will be your daily companions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>gRPC in Go: Complete Guide from Basics to Production Ready Services</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/grpc-in-go-complete-guide-basics-production.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/grpc-in-go-complete-guide-basics-production.html</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Building modern distributed systems is tricky business - you need services that can talk to each other quickly and reliably. That&amp;rsquo;s where gRPC comes in and absolutely crushes it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been building REST APIs for years, but when I first tried gRPC, it was like switching from a bicycle to a sports car. The speed difference is insane, plus you get type safety and can use it with practically any programming language.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>FastAPI Tutorial: Build REST API from Scratch (Beginner Guide)</title><link>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/fastapi-tutorial-build-rest-api-from-scratch-beginner-guide.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 07:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.buanacoding.com/2025/08/fastapi-tutorial-build-rest-api-from-scratch-beginner-guide.html</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Building APIs used to scare me when I first started programming. There&amp;rsquo;s so much to learn - databases, HTTP methods, authentication, error handling. But FastAPI changed everything for me. It&amp;rsquo;s like having training wheels that actually make you faster, not slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to build a real Book Library API from the ground up. No fluff, no complicated setups - just practical, working code that you can understand and expand on. By the end of this guide, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a fully functional REST API that can handle creating, reading, updating, and deleting books.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
