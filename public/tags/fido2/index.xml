They enable fast, convenient logins without passwords and are resistant to phishing. No more weak passwords or OTP codes hijacked via SIM swaps. This guide explains how passkeys work, compares them with legacy 2FA, and shows how to enable them on Google and Apple or use them with password managers like 1Password and Bitwarden.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="summary-what-is-a-passkey">Summary: What Is a Passkey?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A passkey is a passwordless credential based on FIDO2/WebAuthn. Instead of typing a shared secret, you prove possession of a private cryptographic key securely stored on your device (or in a compatible password manager). When you log in, the site/app sends a challenge that only your private key can sign. The server verifies the signature with the public key you registered. No shared secret travels over the network.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
